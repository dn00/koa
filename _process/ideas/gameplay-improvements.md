# Gameplay Improvement Ideas

## Approved for Further Exploration

### Testimony Lock (Core Mechanic Change)
Remove the pre-submission preview. Player commits cards blind — sees contradictions, damage, counter responses AFTER submit, not before. MAJOR contradictions still block (fairness preserved). Everything else is a post-commit reveal. Creates Wordle-like "I think I know → let me find out" dopamine gap. Implementation: remove UI code, not add it.

### Verdict Scale (Outcome Reframing)
Replace binary win/lose with a 4-tier outcome scale. Labels TBD (NOT court-themed — no "acquitted/guilty"). Every tier gets unique KOA dialogue. Middle tier is a soft landing that doesn't sting. Bottom tier is so extreme it's funny and shareable. Mapping is mechanical over existing score inputs (scrutiny, turns, resistance delta, concerns addressed).

**Label brainstorm needed:** Home/smart-home themed tiers instead of legal metaphors. e.g., access levels, KOA trust ratings, fridge permissions, etc.

## Ideas Explored But Not Yet Prioritized

- Reactive KOA (counters deploy in response to plays via decision tree)
- Hybrid info-cost (spend scrutiny to reveal hidden counter details)
- Escalating Alibi (comedy scales with corroboration combo size)
- KOA Remembers (persistent adversary references your play history)
- Scrutiny Rating (rolling 30-day skill score)
- The Objection (KOA reopens a committed card mid-game)
- The Bluff That Backfired (trap cards earn Hesitation tokens)
- The Committed Bit (persona consistency modifies counter penalties)
- KOA's Highlight Reel (losses generate shareable roast cards)
- Alibi Clock (real-time pressure replaces turn budget)

## Rejected

- Draw Per Turn — breaks fairness invariant F4, thins decisions, 5-10x harder puzzle authoring
