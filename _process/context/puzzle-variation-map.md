## Usage Instructions

When generating a puzzle:

1. **Roll for variety** — Pick one item from each category that you haven't used recently
2. **Check combinations** — Make sure time + setting + device + cast create a coherent scenario
3. **Avoid the biases:**
   - NOT 3 AM
   - NOT suburban family home (at least vary the room/zone)
   - NOT sprinkler/washer/speaker
   - NOT "partner confirms" as main alibi
   - NOT sleepwalking as a lie
4. **Test freshness** — Does this feel like any existing puzzle? If yes, swap one element.
