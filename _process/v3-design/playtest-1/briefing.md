# HOME SMART HOME — "The Statement" — Player Briefing

You are a suspect. KOA — your home's AI system — has detected something suspicious. You need to prove your innocence.

---

## How It Works

You have **6 alibi cards**. Each card is a piece of smart home evidence — a doorbell recording, a sensor log, a fitness tracker reading. Each card has:

- **Strength** (1-5): How convincing the evidence is
- **Location**: Where the device is (BEDROOM, BASEMENT, LIVING_ROOM, etc.)
- **Time**: When the event was recorded
- **Source**: Which device produced the evidence
- **Claim**: What the evidence says happened

**The catch:** 2 of your 6 cards are **lies** — fabricated evidence that looks real. You don't know which ones.

---

## The Game

1. KOA presents a scenario and gives you a **hint** about the lies (e.g., what they have in common)
2. You see your 6 cards with all attributes visible
3. You play **1 card per turn** for **3 turns**
4. After each play, KOA reveals whether your card was **TRUTH** or **LIE**
5. After Turn 1, KOA gives you a **reactive hint** based on what you played — this is new information

## Scoring

- **Truth cards** ADD their strength to your score
- **Lie cards** SUBTRACT their strength from your score
- You need to reach the **target score** to be cleared

## Tiers

| Tier | Condition |
|------|-----------|
| FLAWLESS | Reached target with 0 lies played |
| CLEARED | Reached target (may have played a lie) |
| CLOSE | Within 2 points of target |
| BUSTED | Below target by more than 2 |

## Tips

- Use KOA's opening **hint** to think about which cards might be lies
- Your **Turn 1 play** triggers a reactive hint from KOA — pay attention to it
- The reactive hint gives you NEW information to help with Turns 2 and 3

## What You'll See

When you play a card, your character "speaks" — narrating the evidence to KOA in their own words. Then KOA responds with a verdict and commentary.

Example:
```
YOU: "The garage was locked all night. Check the smart lock — nobody opened it."

[garage_lock] -> TRUTH
Score: +3 -> 3

KOA: "Locked tight. Good. But locks aren't the only way in."
```

## Session

You will play **3 puzzles** in order:
1. **"The Power Outage"**
2. **"The Thermostat War"**
3. **"The Hot Tub Incident"**

After all 3 puzzles, you'll fill out a short survey about your experience.

**Think aloud** as you play — narrate what you're noticing, what you're thinking, and why you're making each choice.
