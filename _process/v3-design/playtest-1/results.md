| Marcus | Clue | Deduction from constrained info with hint system |
| Jen | Among Us | Social deduction, reading clues, figuring out who's lying |
| David | Clue + Ace Attorney | Deduction from Clue, spot-the-contradiction from AA |
| Aisha | Poker | Risk management under partial info, reading signals |

## Key Findings

### 1. Safe-play dominance is absolute
All 5 agents converged on the same meta-strategy by P2/P3: play a safe truth on T1, read the reactive hint, play two more safe truths. Marcus, David, and Aisha explicitly called this a "dominant strategy." No one ever benefited from probing. The two agents who probed (Jen T1 P1, Aisha T1 P1) both got punished and immediately stopped.

### 2. P3 difficulty is still inverted (S2 FAIL)
P3 had 100% win rate despite the highest target. The P3 fix (softer scenario, vaguer spa_pump) improved the reasoning requirement — all agents had to think about "protests too much" — but the hint quality still makes P3 the most readable puzzle. Aisha scored S18 at 3 ("P3 was actually easiest"). Marcus scored it 4. The difficulty curve is P1 > P2 > P3 for experienced players.

### 3. Meta-pattern is identifiable in one session
Marcus identified the "loud denial + quiet cover-up" lie structure after P1. David saw the "protests too much" pattern. Aisha called out the "hint grammar" by P2. All three say the meta would become formulaic if not varied. Key quote from Aisha: "once a player learns the hint grammar, the deduction becomes systematic."

### 4. Jen's learning arc validates the teaching design
Jen went CLOSE → CLOSE → FLAWLESS. She ignored the hint in P1 (yolo'd breaker_log), partially used it in P2 (still made a vibes-based T3 mistake), and fully leveraged it in P3. Her P2 mistake (playing smartwatch at score 9 when phone was safer) is exactly the tension the game should produce more of. Her S20 score of 7 ("every loss was 100% my fault") is the strongest fairness signal.

### 5. KOA personality lands across all archetypes
"The cat has no comment" was quoted by 4/5 agents. KOA's closing lines were the most memorable element for Sarah and Jen. Even the analytical players (Marcus, David, Aisha) appreciated the writing while focusing on mechanics. S23 avg 6.2, S22 avg 5.6.

### 6. Narration appreciated but not essential
S28 (narration added to experience) averaged 4.8 — lowest in the immersion category. Aisha scored it 3. The narration works for immersive players (Sarah, Jen) but analytical players treat it as noise. The narrations do carry deductive clues, which analytical players notice (David: "narrations contain deductive clues").

### 7. No one felt punished unfairly
S21 averaged 2.0 (reverse-scored, so low = good). S20 averaged 6.5. Both losers (Jen, Aisha) explicitly said their losses were self-inflicted. The fairness signal is strong.

### 8. Agents want harder puzzles and more variety
Recurring feedback across all 5:
- More ambiguous hints (Marcus, David, Aisha)
- Varied lie structures — not always 1 loud + 1 quiet (Marcus, David, Aisha)
- Hard mode with vaguer hints or more lies (Marcus, Aisha)
- A mechanic that rewards risk-taking / probing (Marcus, David, Aisha)
- Varied hint types beyond location/time (David)

## Comparison: Playtest 1 vs Playtest 2

| Metric | Playtest 1 | Playtest 2 | Delta |
|--------|------------|------------|-------|
| Loss rate | 33% (5/15) | 20% (3/15) | -13% |
| P1 win rate | 60% | 60% | same |
| P2 win rate | 60% | 80% | +20% |
| P3 win rate | 100% | 100% | same |
| NPS avg | 7.6 | 7.6 | same |
| S2 (difficulty curve) | FAIL | FAIL | same |
| FLAWLESS count | 9/15 | 12/15 | +3 |
| BUSTED count | 1/15 | 1/15 | same |
| All 5 play again | Yes | Yes | same |
| Hard pass | 4/4 | 4/4 | same |
| Soft pass | 11/12 | 10/12 | -1 |

**Key changes:**
- P3 fix made spa_pump less trivially identifiable (agents had to reason about "protests too much") but P3 is still the easiest puzzle
- Win rate increased overall (80% vs 67%) — safe-play strategy is more consistently discovered
- S1 (loss rate) dropped from 33% to 20% — barely passing now
- Loss of one soft criterion: S1 was more comfortably passing before

## Action Items

1. **S2 still failing** — P3 needs a harder hint or the puzzle order needs adjustment. Options:
   - Make P3's hint more oblique (remove "protests too much" which is too descriptive)
   - Swap P2 and P3 (P2 is empirically harder)
   - Create a new P3 with genuinely ambiguous hint

2. **Safe-play dominance** — accepted in playtest 1, still present. Not blocking but limits strategic depth for competitive players.

3. **Meta-pattern visibility** — the "loud + quiet" lie structure is identifiable within one session. Future puzzles need varied lie structures to prevent formula-solving.

4. **Loss rate at floor** — 20% is the minimum for S1. If safe-play strategy spreads further, loss rate could drop below threshold.
