# HOME SMART HOME — First Playthrough

## Sarah's Session: "The Thermostat War"

---

*Opens link on the train. Sips coffee.*

Ok so my friend said the AI roasted her, let's see what this is about...

*Reads scenario.*

Hahaha ok "$412 energy bill" and "the cat weighs six pounds and does not have opposable thumbs" — already love the vibe. Someone cranked the thermostat to 85 at 2 AM and I was "sleeping." Got it, I'm sus.

*Reads hint.*

KOA says: "One of the lies is trying too hard to explain why nothing happened. The other one isn't."

Ok so... one lie is like over-explaining, and the other is more chill? Let me look at the cards.

*Scans cards.*

Alright so I've got six cards. Let me just skim these...

- **phone** (str 1) — phone was off after 12:30. Ok that's weak though, only 1 strength.
- **smartwatch** (str 3) — sleep tracking, unbroken light sleep at 2:15. That's decent.
- **doorbell** (str 4) — hallway empty after 12:30. Nice, strong.
- **light_lr** (str 5) — living room light unchanged. OOH that's a 5. Big number.
- **motion_lr** (str 4) — no presence in living room 1-3 AM. Also strong.
- **temp_lr** (str 3) — thermostat change was from a scheduled program, not manual.

Ok the hint says one lie is "trying too hard to explain why nothing happened." Hmm... the temp sensor one literally says "it was the scheduled program, not manual input" — that feels like it's trying really hard to explain away the thermostat thing. And the motion sensor says "no presence detected between 1 and 3 AM" which is also very "nothing happened here, move along."

But I don't want to overthink this. The big play here is that **light_lr** card — it's a 5! If it's truth that's huge. And the claim is just "no lamps, no screens." That doesn't feel like it's trying too hard. It's just... stating a fact.

### TURN 1

I'm going with **light_lr**. Strength 5, if it's legit that's almost the whole target score right there. And it doesn't feel like an "over-explaining" card. Let's go big.

**YOU:** "The living room was dark all night. Light sensor confirms it — no lamps, no screens, no one in there."

*Taps play, holds breath...*

**VERDICT: TRUTH** ✅

**Score: 5/7**

KOA says: "The light sensor is honest. But not every sensor in this house is — and I'm not just talking about the living room."

YES ok nice, 5 points! Wait — "not every sensor in this house is honest" and "not just talking about the living room." So there's a lying sensor that's NOT in the living room? Hmm. The smartwatch is technically a sensor... and it's in the bedroom. Oh wait, but KOA also said "not JUST talking about the living room" — which means there IS a bad sensor in the living room too?

Ok so maybe one lie is a living room sensor and one is... somewhere else. The living room sensors left are **motion_lr** and **temp_lr**. And non-living-room stuff is phone, smartwatch, doorbell.

### TURN 2

I need 2 more points to hit 7. I should play it safe. The **doorbell** is strength 4, it's at the front door — not a sensor KOA was talking about. And the claim is just "hallway was empty, nobody walked past." That doesn't feel like over-explaining. Let's go doorbell.

**YOU:** "The hallway was empty after 12:30. Doorbell cam saw nothing. Nobody walked to the living room."

**VERDICT: TRUTH** ✅

**Score: 9/7**

KOA says: "Empty hallway. Nobody came in. Which means whoever did this was already here."

LMAO KOA. "Whoever did this was already here." I mean... yeah, it was me, probably. But you can't PROVE that!

Ok I've already hit 7! I'm at 9! I could literally play a lie now and still be fine if it's strength 2 or less... but I want that FLAWLESS. Let's see what's left.

Remaining cards: phone (1), smartwatch (3), motion_lr (4), temp_lr (3).

KOA hinted that there's a bad sensor in the living room AND outside it. motion_lr and temp_lr are the living room sensors. Smartwatch is a bedroom "sensor." The hint said one lie "tries too hard to explain why nothing happened" — **motion_lr** literally says "no presence detected" which is screaming "NOTHING HAPPENED" and **temp_lr** says "it was the scheduled program" which is also trying to explain it away...

Actually the smartwatch is "unbroken light sleep" — that's also very "nothing happened, I was asleep." But KOA said a sensor outside the living room is suspect. Smartwatch is outside the living room...

### TURN 3

I'm at 9, target is 7. I want FLAWLESS so I need to avoid both lies. I think the lies are **motion_lr** (living room sensor that over-explains) and **smartwatch** (bedroom sensor). So I should play either **phone** or **temp_lr**.

Phone is only 1 point and it's not a sensor — KOA was talking about sensors. temp_lr IS a sensor in the living room but... KOA said "not JUST the living room" implying there's one IN the living room. But the light sensor was already cleared. So between motion_lr and temp_lr, which one is the lie?

motion_lr: "no presence detected between 1 and 3 AM" — that's very "nothing happened here"
temp_lr: "thermostat adjustment came from the scheduled program" — that's trying to explain the SPECIFIC suspicious event

Ugh ok the hint said one lie is "trying too hard to explain why nothing happened" — temp_lr is explaining why the thermostat change was innocent. That feels like trying too hard. But motion_lr is also... hmm.

You know what, I'm already past the target. Let me just play **temp_lr** because it's 3 points and even if it's a lie I'd be at 9 - 3 = 6, which is... oh wait, that's CLOSE, not CLEARED. That would be bad.

Ok safer play: **phone**, strength 1. Even if it's a lie I lose 1 point, going to 8, still above 7. But I don't think phone is a lie — KOA was talking about sensors and phone isn't really a sensor.

Playing **phone**. Safe. Smart. Boring but smart.

**YOU:** "My phone was dead to the world after 12:30. Zero screen time. I wasn't up scrolling — I was sleeping."

**VERDICT: TRUTH** ✅

**Score: 10/7**

KOA says: "Phone was off. KOA respects a good night's sleep. Allegedly."

HAHA "allegedly." KOA knows.

## FINAL RESULT

**Score: 10/7**
**Lies played: 0**
**Tier: FLAWLESS** 🏆

KOA's closing line: **"Your alibis are airtight. The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment."**

HAHAHAHA THE CAT HAS NO COMMENT. I'm screenshotting this immediately.

*Screenshots. Texts friend: "FLAWLESS first try, the cat has no comment 😭😭"*

## Post-Puzzle Reaction

Ok that was genuinely fun?? The vibe is SO good — the whole thermostat scenario is hilarious and KOA's personality carries this hard. I was actually a little nervous picking cards even though it's just a phone game. The reactive hint after Turn 1 was super helpful — once KOA said "not every sensor is honest" I could narrow things down. I want to play tomorrow's puzzle for sure.

# V3 PLAYTEST SURVEY

## Part 1: Quick Reactions

**QR1:** Smug

**QR2:** Yes

**QR3:** A little — the opening hint was vague but the reactive hint after Turn 1 really helped.

**QR4:** light_lr — going big on Turn 1 with a strength-5 card and having it pay off felt amazing.

**QR5:** "The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment."

---

## Part 2: Structured Assessment

### Engagement
**S1:** 6 — I genuinely want to see tomorrow's puzzle and what new scenario KOA comes up with.
**S2:** 5 — Turn 1 was the most tense because I had the least info. By Turn 3 I felt safer.
**S3:** 6 — The thermostat scenario was funny and specific enough to feel real. I wanted to "win" the argument.
**S4:** 5 — I thought about what would have happened if I'd played motion_lr first and gotten burned.
**S5:** 3 — It was quick enough that I didn't really lose track of time, but I was engaged the whole way through.

### Clarity
**S6:** 5 — The rules made sense but there was a lot of text upfront. I skimmed some of it.
**S7:** 4 — "One is trying too hard, the other isn't" — I got the gist but it was vague enough that I wasn't sure how to apply it.
**S8:** 6 — Truth adds, lie subtracts. Simple. Got it.
**S9:** 6 — I won because I avoided both lies and played high-strength truths. Made sense.
**S10:** 6 — The reactive hint after Turn 1 was genuinely useful. KOA told me about sensors being dishonest and that narrowed things down.

### Deduction
**S11:** 4 — The opening hint was too abstract for me to confidently identify specific lies. I had suspicions but wasn't sure.
**S12:** 6 — Absolutely. KOA's "not every sensor is honest, and not just the living room" comment made me avoid the smartwatch and motion_lr for the rest of the game.
**S13:** 5 — There was real deduction happening, especially after the reactive hint. Turn 1 felt more like a gamble though.
**S14:** 5 — By Turn 3 I definitely knew phone was safe. Turn 1 was more gut feeling.
**S15:** 5 — Location was the most useful attribute — knowing which cards were "living room sensors" helped me use KOA's hint.

### Difficulty
**S16:** 6 — Felt fair. The hint system gave me enough to work with without making it obvious.
**S17:** 6 — I won and it felt earned. I used the reactive hint to avoid the lies.
**S18:** 2 — No, my strategy of "play the big safe card first, then use the hint" worked out.

### KOA
**S19:** 6 — KOA has a distinct voice. Dry, snarky, suspicious of everything. Feels like a character.
**S20:** 7 — "The cat has no comment" is going in my group chat immediately.
**S21:** 6 — The back-and-forth felt like banter, not just game feedback.
**S22:** 5 — The reactive hint directly influenced my Turn 2 and 3 choices.
**S23:** 6 — I read every word KOA said. The personality is the hook.
**S24:** 4 — It felt more collaborative-adversarial? Like I wanted to impress KOA, not defeat KOA.

### Narration & Immersion
**S25:** 5 — The narrations were fun and gave each card personality. "Ask the sensor" on the motion card was funny.
**S26:** 5 — It did feel like presenting evidence, not just clicking a button.
**S27:** 5 — Light interrogation vibes. More playful than intense.
**S28:** 5 — The scenario was funny enough that I cared about the "story" outcome, not just the score.
**S29:** 5 — I read them, mostly because they were short and had personality.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S30:** 5 — It felt earned but also a bit lucky that my Turn 1 gamble paid off.
**S31:** 6 — Once I realized FLAWLESS was possible, I definitely played Turn 3 conservatively to protect it.
**S32:** 5 — The tier system made me think about risk management, especially on Turn 3.
**S33:** 5 — I wanted to know which cards were actually lies to confirm my theory. (I think it was smartwatch and motion_lr?)
**S34:** 6 — Absolutely. I was curious whether my deduction was right.

### Net Promoter Score
**S35:** 8 — I'd tell friends about it. The KOA personality and the shareable results make it a natural recommendation. Needs a few more days of puzzles to see if it stays fresh.

## Part 3: Comparisons & Open-Ended

**C1:** **Wordle.** Daily puzzle format, one-and-done, quick solve, shareable result. The structure is very Wordle — but the content is completely different.

**C2:** Way more personality. Wordle is sterile — green/yellow/gray squares. This has a character roasting you, a funny scenario, and a narrative arc. The share card would be so much more interesting than a grid of colored squares.

**C3:** Wordle is simpler to pick up. I can explain Wordle in 10 seconds. This game has more rules, more text to read, more going on. First-time friction is higher.

**C4:** "This game is basically Wordle but with a snarky AI detective and crime scene evidence instead of letters."

## Part 4: Emotional Journey

**E1:** Amused — "the cat weighs six pounds" lol
**E2:** Intrigued but confused — what does "trying too hard" mean exactly?
**E3:** Scanning — ok big numbers, small numbers, which ones look safe
**E4:** Excited/nervous — going big with the 5, hope it pays off
**E5:** Entertained — the narration gave my play some flair
**E6:** Relieved — YES it's truth, 5 points, let's go
**E7:** Focused — ok KOA just gave me real info, sensors are sus
**E8:** Confident — doorbell feels safe and strong
**E9:** Calculating — I just need to not blow my lead
**E10:** Smug — FLAWLESS baby, screenshot time
**E11:** Curious — want to confirm my theory about the lies

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** The reactive hint after Turn 1: "not every sensor in this house is honest — and I'm not just talking about the living room." That was the "oh!" moment — suddenly I could narrow down the lies to specific cards.

**K2:** Yes. Before the reactive hint, I was considering playing the smartwatch on Turn 2 because it was strength 3 and seemed solid. After KOA hinted that a non-living-room sensor was dishonest, the smartwatch became suspect and I avoided it.

**K3:** Getting FLAWLESS and reading the cat closing line. Perfect combo of achievement and humor.

**K4:** Turn 1 was slightly frustrating because the opening hint was vague enough that I didn't feel confident. I was mostly gambling on the strength-5 card being legit.

**K5:** Turn 1, a little. The opening hint gave me vibes but not certainty. The reactive hint fixed that.

**K6:** "The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment." Also "KOA respects a good night's sleep. Allegedly."

**K7:** No, it felt fair. The hint system progressively gave me more info, which felt like good design.

**K8:** The opening hint phrasing — "trying too hard to explain why nothing happened" vs "the other one isn't." I wasn't sure if "isn't" meant "isn't trying too hard" or "isn't explaining why nothing happened." Slightly ambiguous.

---

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Play the highest-strength card that I feel least likely to be a lie. light_lr at strength 5 felt safe because its claim was simple and factual, not over-explanatory.

**L2:** I looked for cards that seemed to "over-explain." temp_lr ("it was the scheduled program, not manual input") and motion_lr ("no presence detected") both felt like they were trying to cover something up. I used this to avoid motion_lr but I wasn't confident enough to rule out everything.

**L3:** Yes, massively. KOA's hint about sensors being dishonest — including outside the living room — let me identify the smartwatch as the other lie. Without that, I might have played it on Turn 2 or 3.

**L4:** I'd still lead with a high-strength card I feel good about, but I'd pay more attention to the opening hint phrasing. Maybe I'd try to play a card that I think gives me the most useful reactive hint, not just the most points.

**L5:** I think it's more about reading each puzzle. The hints are specific to the scenario, so you can't really have a universal strategy. Maybe "lead with your safest strong card" is a general principle, but the deduction changes every day.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

**M1:** (d) Depends on how good each puzzle is. If they're all this funny, one is enough. If some are bland, I'd want more.

**M2:** (c) I'd pay $1-2 one-time. The personality is worth it, but I'd need to see a week of puzzles first.

**M3:** (b) Tolerable if short. Don't interrupt between turns though — only after the puzzle ends.

**M4:** (a) Phone (iOS/Android app). This is a commute game.

**M5:** (b) Only if I got FLAWLESS or a funny KOA line. Which today I got both, so yes, sharing immediately.

**M6:** (b) 2-5 minutes. Felt about right for a train stop.

**M7:** (b) Just right.

**M8:** (a) Morning routine, (c) Waiting / killing time, (e) Procrastinating.

**M9:** (b) Friend shared their result. That's literally how I found this game today.

**M10:** "It's like Wordle but you're arguing with a snarky AI about whether you committed a crime, and the AI has the best one-liners."

**M11:** A share card with KOA's best line from your session. The shareability IS the retention. If I can text my friends "the cat has no comment" with my FLAWLESS badge, that's the whole loop.

**M12:** Nothing felt broken. The opening hint was a little vague but that might be intentional. The rules briefing is long — could use a quicker tutorial for first-timers.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: "The Thermostat War"
- **Cards played:** T1: light_lr, T2: doorbell, T3: phone
- **Verdicts:** T1: Truth, T2: Truth, T3: Truth
- **Final score / target:** 10/7
- **Tier:** FLAWLESS
- **Did you use the hint?** Sort of — the "trying too hard" phrasing made me suspicious of motion_lr and temp_lr, which steered me toward light_lr for Turn 1.
- **Did the reactive hint help?** Yes, hugely. KOA's comment about dishonest sensors outside the living room made me avoid the smartwatch on later turns.
- **One sentence:** Leading with a high-strength card you feel good about gets you points AND information — the reactive hint is the real game.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** Funny scenarios with KOA lines I want to share. If every puzzle has a "the cat has no comment" moment, I'm playing daily.

**F2:** Repetitive scenarios or KOA lines that feel generated/generic. If the personality dips, the game is just a math puzzle with extra steps.

**F3:** Make the share card INCREDIBLE. Like, it should show your tier, KOA's best line, and the scenario name in a visually sharp format. That's the viral loop. The game is already fun — the share experience needs to match.

**F4:** This is genuinely one of the more charming puzzle games I've tried. The interrogation framing is clever, KOA's voice is consistent and funny, and the hint system creates a real arc across three turns — you go from uncertain to informed. The only risk is whether the writing can stay this good across dozens of puzzles. If it can, this has real Wordle-level daily habit potential. Also: please let me see which cards were the lies after the game ends. I want to confirm my theories! That post-game reveal is satisfying even when you win.
