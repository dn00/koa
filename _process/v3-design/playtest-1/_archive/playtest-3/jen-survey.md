# HOME SMART HOME — First Playthrough

## Jen's Session: "The Thermostat War"

---

*ok so someone in the group chat sent this game and i'm in econ lecture rn so literally anything is better than this. let me see what this is...*

*ok ok so i'm a suspect, my smart home AI is interrogating me because someone cranked the thermostat to 85 at 2 AM and the energy bill is $412. THE CAT HAS BEEN BLAMED. THE CAT WEIGHS SIX POUNDS. lmaooo ok this is already funny. "the cat does not have opposable thumbs" i'm screaming*

*ok so i have 6 cards, 2 are lies, i pick 3. truth adds points, lies subtract. need 7 to be cleared. got it got it.*

*KOA's hint: "One of the lies is trying too hard to explain why nothing happened. The other one isn't."*

*hmm ok so one lie is like overexplaining? let me look at the cards...*

*scrolling through these... ok the narrations are kinda fun. "My phone was dead to the world" lol relatable. the temp sensor one — "The thermostat change was scheduled. It's a program — it does that." that feels like it's trying REAL hard to explain away the whole thing. like that's literally the thing KOA is asking about and this card is like "oh it was just the program lol nothing to see here." that feels sus.*

*and then motion sensor — "no presence detected between 1 and 3 AM" — that's also kinda trying hard? like the room was COMPLETELY empty for 2 whole hours? sure jan.*

*but honestly idk. the hint said one tries too hard and the other DOESN'T try too hard which is confusing. whatever.*

*ok i wanna play something strong and dramatic for turn 1. the doorbell cam is strength 4 and "front hallway empty, no one passed after 12:30 AM" — that's dramatic. empty hallway at night. very horror movie. let's go with that.*

---

### TURN 1: doorbell (Str 4, FRONT_DOOR)

**YOU:** "The hallway was empty after 12:30. Doorbell cam saw nothing. Nobody walked to the living room."

**KOA:** TRUTH. "Empty hallway. Nobody came in. Which means whoever did this was already here."

**Score: 4/7**

**Reactive Hint:** "Nobody came in. So whoever did this was already here. Interesting night."

*ok nice, truth! 4 points. and KOA is like "whoever did this was already here" which is like... ominous but not super helpful? like yeah i live here lol. ok i still need 3 more points to hit 7.*

*hmm the reactive hint didn't really tell me which cards are lies though. just vibes. ok whatever, i need to pick something good.*

*let me think about what's left... i've got phone (1), smartwatch (3), light_lr (5), motion_lr (4), temp_lr (3). i need at least 3 more points and i have 2 turns left.*

*the light sensor is strength 5 and the claim is "ambient light unchanged — no one turned on a lamp." that's strong AND it sounds legit? like a light sensor just... senses light. hard to fake that. and if i get 5 points that puts me at 9 which clears easy.*

*but also... is it trying too hard? "no one turned on a lamp" — i mean it IS explaining why nothing happened. hmm. but the narration says "no lamps, no screens, no one in there" which is just stating facts not overexplaining.*

*you know what, 5 points would be huge. i'm going for it.*

---

### TURN 2: light_lr (Str 5, LIVING_ROOM)

**YOU:** "The living room was dark all night. Light sensor confirms it — no lamps, no screens, no one in there."

**KOA:** TRUTH. "No lamps. The living room was dark and honest. KOA approves."

**Score: 9/7**

*YESSS ok 9 points, i already hit the target! i'm at 9 and i only need 7. so even if my last card is a lie i just need it to not subtract more than 2... wait no. if it's a lie it SUBTRACTS the strength. so if i play something with strength 3 that's a lie, i'd go to 9 - 3 = 6 which is below 7. hmm.*

*ok so i should play something safe. phone is only strength 1, so even if it's a lie i only lose 1 point and end at 8. that's still cleared! but phone is boring and strength 1...*

*actually wait i'm already at 9. phone as a lie = 9-1 = 8. still cleared. smartwatch as a lie = 9-3 = 6. that's BUSTED. motion as a lie = 9-4 = 5. also busted. temp as a lie = 9-3 = 6. also busted.*

*ok the safe play is phone. strength 1, even if it's a lie i'm fine. and honestly "zero screen time after 12:30" is very relatable because sometimes your phone just dies and you pass out.*

*but also... the smartwatch one sounds cool. "unbroken light sleep at 2:15 AM" that's very specific and dramatic. ugh but it's strength 3 and if it's a lie...*

*no ok i'm being smart for once. phone. safe pick. let's lock it in.*

---

### TURN 3: phone (Str 1, BEDROOM)

**YOU:** "My phone was dead to the world after 12:30. Zero screen time. I wasn't up scrolling — I was sleeping."

**KOA:** TRUTH. "Phone was off. KOA respects a good night's sleep. Allegedly."

**Final Score: 10/7**

**Tier: FLAWLESS**

**KOA:** "Your alibis are airtight. The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment."

*FLAWLESS?? WAIT I GOT FLAWLESS??? on my first try??? the cat has no comment i'm DEAD. ok i need to screenshot this immediately.*

*so the lies were smartwatch and motion sensor... the smartwatch was the sneaky one that "isn't trying too hard" and the motion sensor was the one "trying too hard to explain why nothing happened." oh that actually makes sense — the motion sensor was like "NO PRESENCE AT ALL for 2 hours" which IS trying hard. and the smartwatch was just... lying about sleep data. sneaky.*

*ok that was actually really fun?? like i didn't even fully use the hint but i still got flawless because i vibed my way through it. the cat line at the end killed me.*

## Post-Puzzle Reaction

That was honestly way more fun than I expected for a little daily puzzle thing. The scenario was hilarious — blaming a six-pound cat for cranking the thermostat — and KOA has genuine personality. I got FLAWLESS on my first try which felt amazing even though I mostly just picked cards that sounded cool and then got lucky/smart on the last pick. I'd definitely play tomorrow.

# V3 PLAYTEST SURVEY

## Part 1: Quick Reactions

**QR1:** Hyped

**QR2:** Yes

**QR3:** A little — I had a vague sense that the motion sensor and temp sensor were sus from the hint about "trying too hard to explain why nothing happened," but I didn't really use the hint systematically. I mostly vibed.

**QR4:** The doorbell card. "The hallway was empty after 12:30" just sounds like something from a true crime podcast and I loved the energy.

**QR5:** "The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment." I literally need to text this to my group chat.

---

## Part 2: Structured Assessment

### Engagement
**S1:** 6 — I genuinely want to see tomorrow's puzzle. The scenario was funny and I want to see what other unhinged situations come up.

**S2:** 4 — Turn 3 had real tension because I realized a wrong pick could tank my score, but Turns 1 and 2 were more vibes-based.

**S3:** 6 — The thermostat war scenario was hilarious. A six-pound cat with no opposable thumbs being blamed? Chef's kiss.

**S4:** 5 — After seeing the lies revealed I was like "oh I could've used the hint better" which makes me want to try harder tomorrow.

**S5:** 3 — It was pretty quick, which is good for a daily puzzle, but I didn't exactly lose track of time. My professor is still talking about supply curves.

### Clarity
**S6:** 5 — I skimmed and got the gist. Truth adds, lie subtracts, hit the target. The tier system took a second but it's pretty intuitive.

**S7:** 3 — "One of the lies is trying too hard to explain why nothing happened. The other one isn't." I kinda got what it meant but "the other one isn't" was confusing — like ok so the other lie is NOT trying too hard? That doesn't help me find it.

**S8:** 6 — Very intuitive. Truth good, lie bad. Simple.

**S9:** 6 — I won and I understood why — I picked truths and avoided lies. The reveal at the end showing which were lies made it click.

**S10:** 4 — The reactive hint after Turn 1 was more atmospheric than informative for my specific play. It said "whoever did this was already here" which is cool narrative-wise but didn't help me pick cards.

### Deduction
**S11:** 3 — The hint vaguely pointed me toward the motion sensor but I didn't really use it to narrow down the second lie.

**S12:** 3 — The reactive hint from the doorbell play was pretty vague and didn't change my strategy much. I just kept vibing.

**S13:** 4 — It felt like a mix. Turn 3 was genuinely a puzzle (calculating safe picks) but Turns 1-2 were more gut feeling.

**S14:** 5 — By Turn 3 I definitely knew phone was "safe" in terms of risk and smartwatch was a gamble. That felt like real decision-making.

**S15:** 3 — I mostly looked at the claims and narrations, not the location/time/source attributes. Though looking back, the hint about "trying too hard to explain why nothing happened" relates to the claims, not the metadata.

### Difficulty
**S16:** 6 — Felt fair. The target of 7 is reachable even with one mistake, but you have to think about it.

**S17:** 6 — I won and it felt earned because I made a smart risk-management call on Turn 3 instead of going for a big number.

**S18:** 2 — I didn't feel punished at all. The game gave me enough room to succeed.

### KOA
**S19:** 6 — KOA has a whole vibe. The snarky AI investigator thing works really well. "Allegedly" killed me.

**S20:** 7 — "The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment." is going in the group chat immediately.

**S21:** 6 — The back-and-forth felt like an actual conversation, not just picking options from a menu.

**S22:** 3 — KOA's personality kept me engaged but didn't really change WHICH cards I picked. I was picking based on vibes and drama.

**S23:** 6 — I read everything KOA said. The writing is genuinely funny.

**S24:** 4 — It felt more collaborative than adversarial? Like I wanted to impress KOA, not beat KOA.

### Narration & Immersion
**S25:** 6 — I loved that my character had a voice. "My phone was dead to the world" feels way better than just "play phone card."

**S26:** 6 — It really did feel like presenting evidence in an interrogation. "Your honor, the hallway was EMPTY."

**S27:** 5 — Definitely interrogation-adjacent. More like a fun late-night argument with your smart home than a police interrogation.

**S28:** 5 — I genuinely didn't want to get busted. The $412 energy bill and the cat blame made it feel personal.

**S29:** 7 — I read every narration. They're short and punchy and funny. This is the best part of the game honestly.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S30:** 5 — Getting FLAWLESS felt partly earned (smart Turn 3 pick) and partly lucky (Turns 1-2 were vibes).

**S31:** 6 — When I saw FLAWLESS I was genuinely hyped. If I'd just gotten CLEARED I would've been like "eh ok."

**S32:** 5 — Knowing FLAWLESS existed made me want to play all truths even though I didn't need to for CLEARED.

**S33:** 6 — Seeing that smartwatch and motion sensor were the lies was satisfying. The motion sensor one I kinda suspected, the smartwatch was a surprise.

**S34:** 5 — I was curious which ones were lies and whether my vibes-based suspicions were right.

### Net Promoter Score
**S35:** 8 — I'd send this to my group chat for sure. The writing is funny, it's quick, and getting FLAWLESS feels bragworthy.

## Part 3: Comparisons & Open-Ended

**C1:** Among Us — You're trying to figure out who's lying, you have limited information, and the social/personality element matters as much as the logic.

**C2:** It's faster and you can play it solo. Among Us needs like 6 people and 20 minutes minimum. This is 3 minutes under your desk in lecture.

**C3:** Among Us has the social element — arguing with friends, accusing people, the chaos. This is single-player so you don't get that energy.

**C4:** "This game is basically Wordle but with a snarky AI detective and you're the suspect."

---

## Part 4: Emotional Journey

**E1:** Laughing. The cat weighing six pounds and not having opposable thumbs is peak comedy writing.

**E2:** Confused but intrigued. "Trying too hard" — ok I'll keep that in mind I guess.

**E3:** Slightly overwhelmed but excited. Six cards with all this info is a lot to take in but the narrations are fun to read.

**E4:** Confident. Doorbell cam just SOUNDS dramatic and I wanted to lead strong.

**E5:** Delighted. Having my character actually narrate felt immersive and cool. "The hallway was empty after 12:30" — very Law & Order.

**E6:** Relieved and smug. TRUTH baby, 4 points, let's go.

**E7:** Slightly disappointed. The hint was atmospheric but I wanted more concrete info about which cards to avoid.

**E8:** Confident but calculating. Light sensor is strength 5 and I needed points, so the risk/reward was worth it.

**E9:** Genuinely tense. I realized I needed to do math to not blow my lead and actually thought about it instead of vibing.

**E10:** HYPED. FLAWLESS on my first ever puzzle?? Screenshot material.

**E11:** Satisfied and a little surprised. Smartwatch being a lie caught me off guard — I almost played it on Turn 3.

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** Turn 3 when I realized "wait, if I pick something strong and it's a lie, I lose everything" — that was a genuine aha moment where the game shifted from vibes to strategy.

**K2:** Not really from the reactive hint specifically. The opening hint made me slightly suspicious of the motion sensor ("trying too hard to explain why nothing happened") but I didn't change any picks because of the Turn 1 reactive hint.

**K3:** Seeing FLAWLESS and the cat closing line. Peak moment.

**K4:** The reactive hint after Turn 1 being kinda vague. I wanted more juice and got "whoever did this was already here" which is cool narrative-wise but didn't help me play.

**K5:** Turns 1 and 2 were mostly gut feeling. I had the hint but honestly I was picking based on which narrations sounded coolest. Turn 3 was the only time I felt like I had real information (my score buffer) to reason with.

**K6:** "The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment." Absolutely iconic.

**K7:** No, the game felt fair. I never felt like the design was screwing me over.

**K8:** The second part of the opening hint — "The other one isn't" — like ok one lie tries too hard and the other one... doesn't? So it's just... normal? How am I supposed to spot a lie that's acting normal?

---

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Pick the card with the coolest narration that's also reasonably strong. Doorbell cam (strength 4) sounded dramatic and the claim seemed straightforward. No deep analysis.

**L2:** I vaguely registered "trying too hard to explain why nothing happened" and thought the motion sensor and temp sensor were the most suspicious — they both explicitly claim nothing happened. But I didn't rigorously apply it. I mostly just filed it away as background info.

**L3:** Not really. "Whoever did this was already here" is cool flavor text but didn't help me identify lies. If I'd played the smartwatch or motion sensor first, I imagine the reactive hint would've been way more useful since it would've revealed a lie.

**L4:** I'd pay more attention to the opening hint and actually try to narrow down the lies before Turn 1. And maybe play a card I'm suspicious of on Turn 1 so the reactive hint gives me more info, rather than leading with a "safe" feeling card.

**L5:** I think there's probably a strategy around using Turn 1 as an information-gathering play and then using the reactive hint to make smarter Turn 2-3 picks. But each puzzle probably has its own flavor, so reading the specific hints matters.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

**M1:** (a) Yes, perfect — It's like Wordle, one a day keeps it special. If I could binge 10 I'd burn out.

**M2:** (a) Free only — I'm a broke college student. But I'd tell all my friends about it.

**M3:** (b) Tolerable — As long as it's not before the KOA closing line. Don't interrupt KOA.

**M4:** (a) Phone app — This is a phone-under-the-desk-in-lecture game 100%.

**M5:** (b) Only FLAWLESS or funny KOA — I'm sharing this FLAWLESS + the cat line immediately. Wouldn't share a BUSTED unless KOA roasted me really hard.

**M6:** (b) 2-5 min — Felt quick but not rushed. Perfect lecture-avoidance length.

**M7:** (b) Just right — Long enough to feel like a thing, short enough that I'll actually do it daily.

**M8:** (e) Procrastinating — This is a procrastination game. Lecture, waiting for food, avoiding homework.

**M9:** (d) New content — If the scenarios keep being this funny I'll keep coming back. Streak pressure stresses me out (looking at you, Duolingo).

**M10:** "It's like a 3-minute murder mystery where your smart home AI roasts you and you have to prove you didn't crank the thermostat at 2 AM."

**M11:** More scenarios with this level of humor. The writing is carrying hard — if the scenarios get boring, I'm out.

**M12:** The opening hint's second half ("the other one isn't") felt unhelpful to the point of being confusing. Maybe make both halves of the hint actionable?

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: "The Thermostat War"
- **Cards played:** T1: doorbell, T2: light_lr, T3: phone
- **Verdicts:** T1: Truth, T2: Truth, T3: Truth
- **Final score / target:** 10 / 7
- **Tier:** FLAWLESS
- **Did you use the hint? How?** Vaguely. I registered "trying too hard to explain nothing happened" and was slightly suspicious of motion_lr and temp_lr, but I picked cards based on vibes and strength more than the hint.
- **Did the reactive hint help? How?** Not really. The doorbell reactive hint ("whoever did this was already here") was atmospheric but didn't help identify lies.
- **One sentence — what did you learn?** Turn 3 taught me that score management matters — picking the low-strength phone card as insurance was the smartest thing I did all game.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** Funny scenarios and KOA being unhinged. If every day's puzzle has writing this good, I'm in. Also if my friends are playing and we can compare results.

**F2:** If the scenarios get repetitive or the hints stay too vague to actually use. If I get BUSTED three days in a row and don't understand why, I'm deleting the app.

**F3:** Make the reactive hint after Turn 1 more useful regardless of which card you play. I played doorbell and got basically nothing helpful. It should feel like new information every time, not just flavor.

**F4:** The writing is genuinely the star here. KOA's personality, the scenario setup, the player narrations — that's what makes this feel different from other puzzle games. Protect the writing at all costs. Also the cat line needs to be shareable as like a card or image because I WILL be posting that.
