## PUZZLE 1: "The Power Outage"

**Target: 5 | 3 turns | 2 lies among 6 cards**

**Scenario read:** Breaker tripped at 9:14 PM, house dark for 11 minutes, gaming PC died mid-match. Someone was in the basement. I claim I was upstairs all evening.

**Opening hint from KOA:** "One of the lies claims something happened after 11 PM. The other one? You're on your own."

**Think-aloud — analyzing the hand:**

Alright, let me lay out all six cards and cross-reference this hint.

Cards with events after 11 PM:
- fitbit (11:45 PM, Str 3) — Fitbit says I was asleep
- breaker_log (11:15 PM, Str 5) — Smart breaker says it was manually reset
- motion_base (11:30 PM, Str 4) — Basement motion sensor says all-clear after 11 PM

So one of those three is a lie per the hint. The other lie is NOT necessarily after 11 PM — the hint only guarantees one lie is after 11 PM.

Cards before 11 PM:
- doorbell (7:00 PM, Str 4) — Doorbell cam, arrived home at 7
- wifi_log (8:30 PM, Str 3) — Router says PC was online until 9:14
- thermostat (9:00 PM, Str 2) — Bedroom night mode at 9

The second lie could be any of these three OR one of the other after-11 cards.

Let me think about which after-11 card is the lie. The breaker_log claims it was "manually reset at 11:15 PM" — but the scenario says I was upstairs. If the breaker was manually reset, that puts someone in the basement. The claim even says "that wasn't me, it reset itself." That feels suspicious — a manual reset that I'm denying doing? That's either true evidence against me or a fabricated log. Given the hint says one lie is after 11 PM, and this card is the most suspicious one narratively...

The motion_base says "no movement after 11 PM" in the basement. If the breaker WAS manually reset at 11:15, then someone WAS in the basement, which would contradict motion_base. So either breaker_log is lying (no manual reset happened) or motion_base is lying (there WAS movement). They can't both be true if someone reset the breaker manually.

Actually wait — one of these is the hint lie. Could be either. Let me think about what's safe.

The fitbit at 11:45 PM — says I was asleep. That seems benign. Could be a lie but less suspicious.

For the non-11 PM cards: doorbell (Str 4) seems very straightforward. wifi_log (Str 3) — router says PC was online until 9:14, which aligns with the scenario. thermostat (Str 2) — low value, bedroom night mode.

**Strategy for T1:** I want information. I should play a card I'm fairly confident about to get the reactive hint. The doorbell card (Str 4) seems very safe — it's before 11 PM, straightforward claim, high strength. But actually, if I want to probe, I could play a card I'm less sure about. However, this is my first game — I don't want to tank my score. Let me play doorbell for a safe +4 and get a reactive hint.

Actually wait. Target is 5, I have 3 turns. I need to pick 3 truth cards that sum to at least 5. If I pick even one lie, it subtracts. So I need to be strategic about value too.

Let me play **doorbell** (Str 4). Feels safe.

### Turn 1: doorbell (Str 4)

**YOU:** "I got home at 7. Check the doorbell cam — nobody else came in after me. It was just me all night."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. Doorbell cam doesn't lie. Unlike some of these other devices.

**Score: +4 (Running total: 4)**

**Reactive Hint:** "Front door checks out. But something in the basement feels off — and not just the breaker."

**Think-aloud after T1:** Interesting. KOA says "something in the basement feels off — and not just the breaker." That implies the breaker is suspicious AND something else in the basement is too. Basement cards: wifi_log (basement, 8:30 PM), breaker_log (basement, 11:15 PM), motion_base (basement, 11:30 PM).

So KOA is pointing at the basement. "Not just the breaker" — that's at least two basement cards being suspicious? But only 2 lies total. If breaker_log is one lie (after 11 PM, matches the opening hint), then another basement card is the second lie. That would be wifi_log or motion_base.

motion_base is after 11 PM. If both lies were after 11 PM, the hint would probably say "both" not "one." So the second lie is probably NOT after 11 PM. That means wifi_log (8:30 PM, basement) could be the second lie.

That would make the lies: breaker_log and wifi_log. Both basement cards.

If that's right, safe cards are: fitbit (3), thermostat (2), motion_base (4). I already played doorbell (4). I need 1 more point to hit 5.

I'll play **thermostat** (Str 2) as a safe pick to get to 6, then **fitbit** (Str 3) for Turn 3 to be safe.

Actually, I only need 1 more point. Let me play fitbit (Str 3) — I'm fairly confident it's truth.

### Turn 2: fitbit (Str 3)

**YOU:** "Check my Fitbit. Heart rate dropped to resting by 11:45. I was asleep. End of story."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. Your heart rate says innocent. KOA accepts this. Grudgingly.

**Score: +3 (Running total: 7)**

I've already hit 5. Now Turn 3 is gravy. Let me play motion_base (Str 4) — I believe it's truth based on my deduction.

### Turn 3: motion_base (Str 4)

**YOU:** "The basement sensor says all-clear. No movement after 11. Nobody went down there."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. Basement was quiet. Good. That's one less room KOA has to worry about.

**Score: +4 (Running total: 11)**

**Final Score: 11 / Target: 5**

**Lies played: 0**

**Tier: FLAWLESS**

**KOA Closing:** "Every alibi checks out. Not a single lie. Your gaming PC died for nothing. Go back to bed."

**Lie Reveal:**
- wifi_log (Str 3, BASEMENT, 8:30 PM) — LIE (Stealth). The router data was fabricated.
- breaker_log (Str 5, BASEMENT, 11:15 PM) — LIE (Hint lie). The breaker was never manually reset.

**Post-puzzle reflection:** Nailed it. The hint narrowed one lie to after-11-PM cards, and the reactive hint about "the basement" confirmed both lies were basement-sourced. My deduction was correct — breaker_log was the hint lie, wifi_log was the stealth lie. Both basement. The key was the reactive hint saying "not just the breaker." That was very generous information. Feeling good. Let's see if Puzzle 2 is harder.

## PUZZLE 2: "The Thermostat War"

**Target: 7 | 3 turns | 2 lies among 6 cards**

**Scenario read:** August, $412 energy bill, thermostat cranked to 85 at 2 AM. Cat blamed. Cat has no opposable thumbs. I was "sleeping."

**Opening hint from KOA:** "One of the lies is from a sensor in the living room. The other one isn't."

**Think-aloud — analyzing the hand:**

Living room cards:
- light_lr (Str 5, LIVING_ROOM, 1:45 AM) — light unchanged
- motion_lr (Str 4, LIVING_ROOM, 2:00 AM) — no presence 1-3 AM
- temp_lr (Str 3, LIVING_ROOM, 1:50 AM) — thermostat change was scheduled

One of these three is a lie. The other lie is NOT in the living room.

Non-living-room cards:
- phone (Str 1, BEDROOM, 1:00 AM) — zero screen activity after 12:30
- smartwatch (Str 3, BEDROOM, 2:15 AM) — unbroken light sleep
- doorbell (Str 4, FRONT_DOOR, 12:30 AM) — hallway empty after 12:30

One of these three is the other lie.

Target is 7. That's high. Max possible from 3 truths = picking the three highest truths. I need to be careful.

Let me think about which living room card is the lie. The thermostat was cranked to 85 at 2 AM. If someone was in the living room doing that:
- motion_lr says no presence 1-3 AM. If someone was there at 2 AM, this is a lie.
- light_lr says no lights turned on. Someone could adjust a thermostat in the dark.
- temp_lr says the change was scheduled. If it was scheduled, no one needed to be there.

motion_lr directly contradicts someone being in the living room at 2 AM. That seems like the most likely lie.

For the non-living-room lie: smartwatch says unbroken sleep at 2:15 AM. If I got up to change the thermostat at 2 AM, my watch would show disrupted sleep. So smartwatch could be the lie. phone (Str 1) — zero activity, but I might not need my phone to walk to the thermostat. doorbell (Str 4) — hallway empty, but I wouldn't need to go to the front door.

I'm suspicious of smartwatch. If I walked to the living room at 2 AM, the watch would catch movement.

So my hypothesis: lies are motion_lr and smartwatch.

Safe cards: phone (1), doorbell (4), light_lr (5), temp_lr (3).

Target is 7. Best 3 truths from my safe list: light_lr (5) + doorbell (4) + temp_lr (3) = 12. Or phone(1) + doorbell(4) + light_lr(5) = 10. I have room.

**T1 strategy:** Play a high-value safe card. light_lr (Str 5) seems safe and high value. Let me play it.

### Turn 1: light_lr (Str 5)

**YOU:** "The living room was dark all night. Light sensor confirms it — no lamps, no screens, no one in there."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. No lamps. The living room was dark and honest. KOA approves.

**Score: +5 (Running total: 5)**

**Reactive Hint:** "The light sensor is honest. But not every sensor in this house is — and I'm not just talking about the living room."

**Think-aloud after T1:** "Not every sensor in this house is [honest]" — sensors include motion_lr, temp_lr, light_lr (cleared), and other devices. "Not just talking about the living room" confirms a non-living-room device is also lying. This aligns with my hypothesis.

I need 2 more points. doorbell (Str 4) seems safe. Let me play it.

### Turn 2: doorbell (Str 4)

**YOU:** "The hallway was empty after 12:30. Doorbell cam saw nothing. Nobody walked to the living room."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. Nobody came in. So whoever did this was already here — and maybe closer to you than you think.

**Score: +4 (Running total: 9)**

Already past 7. Turn 3 — let me play temp_lr (Str 3) to pad the score and confirm my read.

### Turn 3: temp_lr (Str 3)

**YOU:** "The thermostat change was scheduled. It's a program — it does that. Nobody got up to crank it to 85."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. Scheduled program. Boring. Trustworthy. KOA accepts.

**Score: +3 (Running total: 12)**

**Final Score: 12 / Target: 7**

**Lies played: 0**

**Tier: FLAWLESS**

**KOA Closing:** "Your alibis are airtight. The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment."

**Lie Reveal:**
- smartwatch (Str 3, BEDROOM, 2:15 AM) — LIE (Stealth). Sleep tracking fabricated.
- motion_lr (Str 4, LIVING_ROOM, 2:00 AM) — LIE (Hint lie). Motion sensor lied about no presence.

**Post-puzzle reflection:** Two for two, both FLAWLESS. My hypothesis was exactly right. The pattern I'm noticing: the hint lie is the one that most directly contradicts the scenario (motion sensor says nobody was in the room where the thermostat was changed). The stealth lie is more subtle — a personal device corroborating your alibi. The opening hint splits the search space cleanly: one lie in group A, one in group B. Then narrative logic and the reactive hint confirm. I'm starting to see a strategy: identify the "protest too much" card and the "too-convenient alibi" card.

## PUZZLE 3: "The Hot Tub Incident"

**Target: 8 | 3 turns | 2 lies among 6 cards**

**Scenario read:** 6 AM, back deck flooded, hot tub cover off, $2,200 water damage. I was "in bed the whole time." Someone was out there.

**Opening hint from KOA:** "One of the lies flat-out denies something happened. It protests too much. The other one? Subtler."

**Think-aloud — analyzing the hand:**

This hint is different — it's about the nature of the lie rather than location or time. Let me categorize:

Cards that "deny something happened" (protest too much):
- spa_pump (Str 5, DECK, 3:00 AM) — "no pump activation after 10 PM." The hot tub overflowed. If the pump didn't run... but the deck is flooded. This protests too much. If the tub overflowed, the pump likely ran.
- smart_lock (Str 4, BACK_DOOR, 2:45 AM) — "zero unlock events." Denies anyone went outside.
- motion_hall (Str 5, HALLWAY, 3:10 AM) — "no movement toward back of house." Denies anyone walked that way.

Actually, all three of those deny something happened. But which one "protests too much"?

spa_pump: The deck is flooded from the hot tub. The pump says it didn't run. That's a direct denial of the most obvious cause. That feels like "protesting too much."

smart_lock: Zero unlock events — but maybe I went out earlier and left it unlocked? Or used another exit?

motion_hall: No movement — strong denial.

"Subtler" lie — that would be something that seems innocuous:
- fitbit (Str 2) — REM sleep from 1-5 AM. Mundane.
- thermostat (Str 3) — hallway temp steady, doors closed. Could be subtly wrong if a door was opened.
- water_meter (Str 3) — baseline 0.2 gal/hr. If the hot tub was running, this should spike. This is subtly lying about utility data.

Hmm. Let me think harder. The deck flooded from the hot tub. The pump says it didn't activate — but the deck is underwater. That's a flat denial. spa_pump = hint lie candidate.

The subtle lie... water_meter says baseline usage all night. But if the hot tub was filling/running, water usage would spike. So it's quietly lying about the evidence — subtle.

Hypothesis: spa_pump (hint lie, "protests too much") and water_meter (stealth lie, "subtler").

Safe cards: fitbit (2), thermostat (3), smart_lock (4), motion_hall (5).

Target is 8. Best 3 from safe: motion_hall (5) + smart_lock (4) + thermostat (3) = 12. That works.

I should play motion_hall (Str 5) first — high value and I believe it's truth.

### Turn 1: motion_hall (Str 5)

**YOU:** "The hallway sensor didn't pick up anything. No one walked toward the back of the house. Not me, not anyone."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. No hallway movement. Clean. But the deck didn't flood itself.

**Score: +5 (Running total: 5)**

**Reactive Hint:** "No movement in the hallway. Noted. But the real question isn't who walked — it's what the utilities recorded."

**Think-aloud after T1:** "What the utilities recorded" — utilities = water_meter, spa_pump, thermostat. KOA is pointing at utility data. That supports my hypothesis that water_meter and spa_pump are lies. Thermostat is a utility too but I think it's clean.

I need 3 more points. smart_lock (Str 4) is safe.

### Turn 2: smart_lock (Str 4)

**YOU:** "The back door didn't open once. Zero unlock events from 10 PM to 6 AM. Nobody went outside. Period."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. Zero unlocks. The back door stayed shut. So how did someone get to the deck...?

**Score: +4 (Running total: 9)**

Already past 8. Turn 3 — thermostat (Str 3) to lock in FLAWLESS.

### Turn 3: thermostat (Str 3)

**YOU:** "The hallway held at 71 all night. If someone opened the back door, you'd see a temp drop. You don't."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. Doors stayed closed, temp held steady. Your hallway is innocent. Your deck is not.

**Score: +3 (Running total: 12)**

**Final Score: 12 / Target: 8**

**Lies played: 0**

**Tier: FLAWLESS**

**KOA Closing:** "Every alibi checks out. You told nothing but the truth. $2,200 in damages, though. KOA is billing you anyway."

**Lie Reveal:**
- water_meter (Str 3, UTILITY, 3:30 AM) — LIE (Stealth). Baseline water usage was fabricated — the tub was running.
- spa_pump (Str 5, DECK, 3:00 AM) — LIE (Hint lie). The pump did activate. It lied about no activation.

**Post-puzzle reflection:** Three for three, all FLAWLESS. The pattern is now clear to me: the hint lie is the card that most blatantly contradicts the scenario premise (the "protest too much" card), and the stealth lie is the subtler corroborating data that quietly covers up evidence. The opening hint splits the search space, and narrative logic does the rest. Once you identify the two lies, you just pick three high-value truths and you're golden. The reactive hints were generous — "utilities" pointed right at the answer both times I could cross-reference.

# SURVEY RESPONSES

## Part 1: Quick Reactions

**QR1:** Satisfied
**QR2:** Confident
**QR3:** Yes
**QR4:** Yes, clearly
**QR5:** P3 — the hint about "protests too much" vs. "subtler" was the most interesting deduction challenge because it required reasoning about the nature of the lie rather than just filtering by metadata.

## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7)

**S1:** 6 — I wanted to keep playing after each puzzle.
**S2:** 4 — Some tension, but once I identified the lies, the choices felt clear.
**S3:** 6 — The scenarios were fun and grounded. I liked the absurdity of the cat blame.
**S4:** 3 — I didn't lose, so this didn't really apply.
**S5:** 4 — Engaged but not lost-in-time level. Each puzzle was quick.
**S6:** 7 — Rules were crystal clear after reading the briefing.
**S7:** 7 — The opening hints were well-structured and immediately actionable.
**S8:** 7 — Very intuitive. Truth adds, lie subtracts. Simple.
**S9:** N/A — Did not lose.
**S10:** 6 — Reactive hints confirmed hypotheses effectively.
**S11:** 7 — The opening hint was the primary deduction tool every time.
**S12:** 5 — It confirmed my read but didn't change my plan.
**S13:** 7 — Absolutely solving a puzzle, not guessing.
**S14:** 6 — By T2/T3 I knew which cards were safe. T1 was the educated gamble.
**S15:** 7 — Location and time were critical for cross-referencing hints.
**S16:** 7 — By P3 I had a clear framework: use hint to split, use narrative logic to identify, play safe truths.
**S17:** 5 — Fair but perhaps too easy once you read the hint carefully.
**S18:** 4 — The target was higher but the deduction wasn't necessarily harder.
**S19:** 4 — Difficulty didn't ramp enough. All three felt solvable with the same approach.
**S20:** N/A — Did not lose.
**S21:** 2 — The game did not punish reasonable play. (Low = good, since reverse-scored.)
**S22:** 5 — KOA has personality. The quips land. But it's still clearly a system.
**S23:** 6 — "The cat has no comment" made me smile. "KOA is not an idiot" was good too.
**S24:** 5 — Enjoyable flavor, but it's one-directional — I don't get to respond TO KOA.
**S25:** 4 — KOA's hints informed decisions, but the deduction framework did most of the work.
**S26:** 6 — I read everything. The writing is good.
**S27:** 4 — Didn't feel adversarial. More like a collaborative puzzle.
**S28:** 5 — Nice flavor but I focused more on the mechanical choice.
**S29:** 5 — It felt like selecting evidence, which is thematic enough.
**S30:** 5 — Interrogation-lite. The narrations sell it.
**S31:** 4 — I cared about winning and the puzzle, less about the fictional outcome.
**S32:** 7 — I read every narration.
**S33:** 6 — Felt earned through deduction, though the puzzles may be too solvable.
**S34:** 7 — Absolutely. FLAWLESS was the goal every time.
**S35:** 6 — The tier system motivated careful play over gambling.
**S36:** 6 — Confirming my hypothesis at the end was satisfying.
**S37:** 7 — I wanted to know exactly which cards were lies and whether my model was correct.
**S38:** 7

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Clue — deduction from constrained information with a structured hint system.
**C2:** The hint system is more elegant than Clue's process-of-elimination. You get meaningful information that requires interpretation, not just binary yes/no.
**C3:** Less replayability per puzzle. Clue has combinatorial variety. Here, once you solve it, it's solved.
**C4:** "This game is basically Clue but with narrative alibis and an AI interrogator."

## Part 4: Emotional Journey

**E1:** Intrigued — good scenario setup
**E2:** Focused — immediately started categorizing
**E3:** Analytical — scanning for patterns
**E4:** Calculated — chose safe high-value
**E5:** Immersive — nice touch
**E6:** Validated
**E7:** Confirming — usually matched my hypothesis
**E8:** Confident
**E9:** Comfortable — outcome already secured
**E10:** Satisfied
**E11:** Confirmed — matched my deduction
**E12:** N/A — no share card shown

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** P1 reactive hint: "not just the breaker" — that clicked the whole basement-lies theory into place.
**K2:** P1 reactive hint shifted my confidence on wifi_log from "maybe safe" to "probably lie" by emphasizing the basement.
**K3:** Getting FLAWLESS on P1 as a first-time player. Validated my analytical approach.
**K4:** No real frustration. If anything, P2 and P3 felt too similar in structure to P1.
**K5:** Never felt like pure guessing. The hints always gave enough to work with.
**K6:** "The cat has no comment."
**K7:** No. The design felt fair throughout.
**K8:** Nothing was confusing. The rules were clear. My only question: is there a benefit to playing a lie intentionally for information? The answer seems to be no — it just hurts your score.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** T1 was always "play a high-value card I'm confident is truth to bank points and get a reactive hint." This didn't change because it kept working.
**L2:** The opening hint split the 6 cards into groups. I identified which group contained a lie, then used narrative logic to pick the specific liar in each group.
**L3:** The reactive hint confirmed my hypothesis every time. P1's "not just the breaker" was the most useful — it narrowed the second lie to the basement.
**L4:** Yes. The hint lie "protests too much" — it directly contradicts the scenario. The stealth lie is subtler corroborating data (router logs, smartwatch sleep, water meter baseline). The pattern: one loud denial, one quiet cover-up.
**L5:** I'd try playing a suspected lie on T1 to see if the reactive hint for a lie is more informative. Risk vs. information trade-off.
**L6:** There's a correct strategy: use the hint to partition, use narrative logic to identify lies, play safe truths. Each puzzle has the same meta-structure.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

**M1:** Daily puzzle
**M2:** 1-2 weeks — unless difficulty ramps or mechanics evolve
**M3:** Free+ads or $1-2 one-time
**M4:** Daily puzzles and hard mode. Leaderboards would add competition.
**M5:** Tolerable
**M6:** Phone app first, browser second
**M7:** Only FLAWLESS or funny KOA lines
**M8:** If the puzzles got harder and I hit a genuinely tricky one — I'd share the challenge.
**M9:** 2-5 min each
**M10:** Just right for a daily puzzle. Too short for a session game.
**M11:** Before bed
**M12:** Streak and new story
**M13:** Yes, after I solve it
**M14:** Friends only
**M15:** "A 5-minute deduction puzzle where you pick alibis and an AI judge catches your lies."
**M16:** Partially accurate — it has the daily-puzzle feel, but "comic strip" undersells the deduction layer. It's more "daily puzzle meets detective game."
**M17:** Harder puzzles. The current hint system makes deduction too reliable for experienced puzzle gamers. Add ambiguity — hints that misdirect, or puzzles where the narrative logic is less clear-cut.
**M18:** The three puzzles all had the same meta-structure (one "loud" lie, one "quiet" lie, hint cleanly partitions). Once I identified the pattern in P1, P2 and P3 were solved almost identically. Varying the lie structure would improve replayability.

## Part 8: Run Log

**Puzzle 1 — The Power Outage**
- Cards: doorbell (T1), fitbit (T2), motion_base (T3)
- Verdicts: Truth, Truth, Truth
- Score: 11 / Target: 5 — FLAWLESS
- Hint usage: Used opening hint to identify after-11-PM lie candidates (fitbit, breaker_log, motion_base). Narrowed to breaker_log as most suspicious.
- Reactive hint: "Not just the breaker" confirmed a second basement lie, leading me to wifi_log.
- Learned: The opening hint partitions the card pool. Narrative logic identifies the specific liars.

**Puzzle 2 — The Thermostat War**
- Cards: light_lr (T1), doorbell (T2), temp_lr (T3)
- Verdicts: Truth, Truth, Truth
- Score: 12 / Target: 7 — FLAWLESS
- Hint usage: One lie in living room, one not. Identified motion_lr as the living room lie (directly contradicts scenario). Smartwatch as the personal-device lie.
- Reactive hint: "Not every sensor is honest, not just the living room" confirmed a non-LR lie existed. Already knew this.
- Learned: The "protest too much" card is usually the one that denies the scenario's core event.

**Puzzle 3 — The Hot Tub Incident**
- Cards: motion_hall (T1), smart_lock (T2), thermostat (T3)
- Verdicts: Truth, Truth, Truth
- Score: 12 / Target: 8 — FLAWLESS
- Hint usage: "Protests too much" = spa_pump (denies pump ran despite flooded deck). "Subtler" = water_meter (quietly fabricates baseline data).
- Reactive hint: "What the utilities recorded" pointed at utility devices, confirming my read.
- Learned: Same pattern as P1/P2 — confirmed my meta-strategy works consistently.

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** Harder puzzles, more varied lie structures, and occasionally misleading hints. I want to feel genuinely uncertain on Turn 2. Also: a streak system with escalating difficulty.

**F2:** If every puzzle is solvable with the same partition-and-eliminate strategy. I need to be surprised.

**F3:** Add a puzzle difficulty where the opening hint is ambiguous or applies to more than 3 cards, forcing a real gamble on T1.

**F4:** This is a well-designed core loop with excellent writing. KOA has real personality. The deduction feels fair and earned. But for a player like me — someone who reads every rule and optimizes — the current difficulty is too low once the meta-strategy clicks. The game needs a "hard mode" where the hints are vaguer, the lies are less narratively obvious, and FLAWLESS requires genuine risk-taking. Also consider: what if playing a lie gave you bonus information? That would create an interesting risk/reward tension — sacrifice points for intel. Right now there's no incentive to ever play a suspected lie, which removes a whole strategic dimension.
