## THINK-ALOUD LOGS

### Puzzle 1: "The Power Outage"

Okay, morning commute, coffee's hot, let's do this...

Reading scenario... breaker tripped, gaming PC died, someone was in the basement. I say I was upstairs. Got it.

Hint says: "One of the lies claims something happened after 11 PM. The other one? You're on your own."

So one lie is after 11 PM... let me scan... after 11 PM cards are: fitbit (11:45 PM), breaker_log (11:15 PM), motion_base (11:30 PM). One of those is a lie. Cool.

Looking at my hand... ooh, breaker_log is strength 5! That's the biggest one. But wait, it's at 11:15 PM, which is after 11... could be the hint lie. Hmm. Let me not pick that one yet.

Doorbell is strength 4, that's solid. Front door, 7 PM -- not after 11. Should be safe. Let me go big and safe.

**TURN 1: doorbell (Str 4)**

> YOU: "I got home at 7. Check the doorbell cam -- nobody else came in after me. It was just me all night."

KOA VERDICT: TRUTH. +4 points. Score: 4/5

> "Doorbell cam doesn't lie. Unlike some of these other devices."

REACTIVE HINT: "Front door checks out. But something in the basement feels off -- and not just the breaker."

Okay so the basement is sketchy. Basement cards are... wifi_log, breaker_log, motion_base. KOA says something in the basement is off. And the hint said one lie is after 11 PM...

Breaker_log is basement AND after 11 PM -- that's gotta be the hint lie. Strength 5 though, ugh, that would wreck me. Definitely avoiding that.

I need 1 more point to hit target. Thermostat is strength 2, bedroom, 9 PM. Not after 11, not basement. Safe bet. That gets me to 6, which clears 5.

**TURN 2: thermostat (Str 2)**

> YOU: "The thermostat went to night mode at 9. Nobody touched it after. I was in bed."

KOA VERDICT: TRUTH. +2 points. Score: 6/5

> "Thermostat checks out. The bedroom was cozy and honest."

Nice! I've already hit target! Turn 3 is just gravy. Let me play it safe -- fitbit, strength 3. Sleep data at 11:45 PM. Could be the after-11 lie but I feel like breaker_log is more obviously the lie since KOA kept pointing at the basement.

**TURN 3: fitbit (Str 3)**

> YOU: "Check my Fitbit. Heart rate dropped to resting by 11:45. I was asleep. End of story."

KOA VERDICT: TRUTH. +3 points. Final Score: 9/5

> "Your heart rate says innocent. KOA accepts this. Grudgingly."

**TIER: FLAWLESS** (reached target, 0 lies played)

> "Every alibi checks out. Not a single lie. Your gaming PC died for nothing. Go back to bed."

LIE REVEAL: The lies were **wifi_log** (router data was fabricated) and **breaker_log** (breaker was never manually reset at 11:15 PM).

Oh wow, FLAWLESS on my first try! The hint totally saved me -- I avoided the after-11 breaker_log, and I just happened to dodge wifi_log too. That felt good.

### Puzzle 2: "The Thermostat War"

LOL $412 energy bill? The cat? This is great.

Hint: "One of the lies is from a sensor in the living room. The other one isn't."

Living room cards: light_lr (Str 5), motion_lr (Str 4), temp_lr (Str 3). One of those is a lie. And one lie is NOT living room.

Non-living room: phone (Str 1), smartwatch (Str 3), doorbell (Str 4).

Target is 7. That's high. I need big cards. Doorbell is strength 4 and NOT living room, so it's safe from the living room lie. Seems legit. Let me start there.

**TURN 1: doorbell (Str 4)**

> YOU: "The hallway was empty after 12:30. Doorbell cam saw nothing. Nobody walked to the living room."

KOA VERDICT: TRUTH. +4 points. Score: 4/7

> "Nobody came in. So whoever did this was already here -- and maybe closer to you than you think."

REACTIVE HINT: "Nobody came in. So whoever did this was already here -- and maybe closer to you than you think."

"Closer to you than you think" -- like something on me? The smartwatch? Or the phone? Interesting. Need 3 more points minimum.

Light_lr at strength 5 would get me to 9. That's great! And there's a 2/3 chance it's not the living room lie. Let me go for it.

**TURN 2: light_lr (Str 5)**

> YOU: "The living room was dark all night. Light sensor confirms it -- no lamps, no screens, no one in there."

KOA VERDICT: TRUTH. +5 points. Score: 9/7

> "No lamps. The living room was dark and honest. KOA approves."

YES! I'm at 9, target is 7. Phone at strength 1 is basically a freebie. Even if it's a lie, 9-1 = 8, still cleared. Lock it in.

**TURN 3: phone (Str 1)**

> YOU: "My phone was dead to the world after 12:30. Zero screen time. I wasn't up scrolling -- I was sleeping."

KOA VERDICT: TRUTH. +1 point. Final Score: 10/7

> "Phone was off. KOA respects a good night's sleep. Allegedly."

**TIER: FLAWLESS** (reached target, 0 lies played)

> "Your alibis are airtight. The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment."

LIE REVEAL: The lies were **smartwatch** (sleep tracking was fabricated) and **motion_lr** (motion sensor in the living room lied about no presence).

Two for two FLAWLESS! The "closer to you" hint was about the smartwatch -- glad I didn't play that. And motion_lr was the living room lie. I feel like a genius right now.

### Puzzle 3: "The Hot Tub Incident"

$2,200 in water damage?? Okay this one sounds serious.

Hint: "One of the lies flat-out denies something happened. It protests too much. The other one? Subtler."

So one lie is a big denial and one is sneaky. Target is 8 -- highest yet.

Scanning... spa_pump (Str 5) -- "no pump activation recorded." That sounds like a flat-out denial! "Protests too much." That's probably the hint lie. Also motion_hall (Str 5) -- "no movement detected." That's also a denial... hmm.

The subtle lie... water_meter? "Baseline 0.2 gal/hr" -- that's subtle, not denying anything, just claiming normal readings. Could be the sneaky one.

I need 8 points. Smart_lock (Str 4) seems safe -- back door lock. Let's start there.

**TURN 1: smart_lock (Str 4)**

> YOU: "The back door didn't open once. Zero unlock events from 10 PM to 6 AM. Nobody went outside. Period."

KOA VERDICT: TRUTH. +4 points. Score: 4/8

> "Zero unlocks. The back door stayed shut. So how did someone get to the deck...?"

REACTIVE HINT: "The lock is honest. Nobody used the door. But the damage happened anyway -- and one device is lying about the evidence."

"Lying about the evidence" -- so one device is covering up what happened. I need 4 more points. Motion_hall is strength 5, hallway sensor. If the back door didn't open, maybe nobody DID walk that way. That sounds legit! 4+5 = 9, clears 8!

**TURN 2: motion_hall (Str 5)**

> YOU: "The hallway sensor didn't pick up anything. No one walked toward the back of the house. Not me, not anyone."

KOA VERDICT: TRUTH. +5 points. Score: 9/8

> "No hallway movement. Clean. But the deck didn't flood itself."

Yes! 9 points, target 8. One more turn. Fitbit at strength 2 is my safest bet. REM sleep, bedroom -- nothing to do with the deck. Even if it's a lie, I'd be close. But I don't think it is.

**TURN 3: fitbit (Str 2)**

> YOU: "I was in REM sleep from 1 to 5 AM. Four straight hours. My Fitbit logged every cycle. I didn't move."

KOA VERDICT: TRUTH. +2 points. Final Score: 11/8

> "REM cycles don't lie. You were asleep. The hot tub was not."

**TIER: FLAWLESS** (reached target, 0 lies played)

> "Every alibi checks out. You told nothing but the truth. $2,200 in damages, though. KOA is billing you anyway."

LIE REVEAL: The lies were **spa_pump** (pump DID activate -- the "protests too much" lie) and **water_meter** (water usage was NOT baseline -- the subtle lie).

THREE FOR THREE FLAWLESS!! I'm officially obsessed. KOA billing me anyway is hilarious.

### Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Wordle -- short daily puzzle you can do on the commute, with a satisfying reveal at the end and a share-worthy result.
**C2:** The character voice (KOA) makes it way more entertaining than staring at colored tiles. There's actual personality here.
**C3:** Wordle's rules are simpler -- I can explain Wordle in 10 seconds. This took me a minute to get the scoring.
**C4:** "This game is basically Wordle but with a snarky detective and alibis instead of letters."

### Part 4: Emotional Journey

**E1:** Amused -- "someone was in the basement" okay drama
**E2:** Focused -- okay this is a real clue, pay attention
**E3:** Scanning -- which ones are big numbers?
**E4:** Cautiously optimistic -- going with my gut
**E5:** Immersed -- oh I'm actually SAYING this to KOA
**E6:** Relief/excitement -- YES it's truth!
**E7:** Alert -- okay this changes things
**E8:** More confident
**E9:** Locking it in
**E10:** Pumped -- FLAWLESS baby!
**E11:** Satisfying -- oh THAT was the lie, makes sense
**E12:** Want to screenshot this

### Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** Puzzle 2 when KOA said "closer to you than you think" and I realized that meant the smartwatch was the lie. That was a genuine aha moment.
**K2:** Puzzle 1 -- the reactive hint about "something in the basement feels off" confirmed my suspicion about breaker_log and made me avoid all basement cards.
**K3:** Getting three FLAWLESS in a row. Felt like I cracked the code.
**K4:** Nothing really frustrated me since I won, but Puzzle 3's target of 8 was stressful -- I had to do math while holding coffee.
**K5:** Turn 3 of Puzzle 1 -- I had already cleared but didn't know if fitbit was the after-11 lie. Felt like a coin flip.
**K6:** "The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment." I literally snorted on the train.
**K7:** No, the design felt fair. The hints always gave me enough to work with.
**K8:** Initially understanding that lies SUBTRACT strength -- I had to re-read that. My first instinct was "lie = 0 points" not "lie = negative points."

### Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Turn 1 I always picked a high-strength card that I was fairly confident was truth based on the hint. By Puzzle 3 I was more deliberate about using the hint to eliminate the obvious lie first, then picking something safe and strong.
**L2:** I used it to mark 1-2 cards as "probably the lie" and avoided those. It narrowed my safe picks.
**L3:** Yes -- in Puzzle 1, the reactive hint about the basement confirmed breaker_log was bad. In Puzzle 2, "closer to you" pointed me away from smartwatch.
**L4:** The lies tend to be the cards that conveniently explain away the most suspicious evidence. Like the spa pump saying "nope, didn't run" when the hot tub clearly overflowed.
**L5:** I'd pay more attention to which cards "protest too much" from the start. The lies are often the ones that are too perfectly exonerating.
**L6:** There's a real strategy: use the hint to eliminate the obvious lie, use the reactive hint to narrow the second one, and manage your score buffer with card strength. It's not just guessing.

### Part 7: Product & Market Fit

**M1:** Daily puzzle
**M2:** Month+ (as long as KOA stays funny and the scenarios stay fresh)
**M3:** Free+ads, would consider $1-2/mo if I got hooked
**M4:** Daily puzzles and new characters
**M5:** Tolerable
**M6:** Phone app
**M7:** Only FLAWLESS or funny KOA lines
**M8:** The KOA quotes. If I could share a result card with the closing line, my friends would want to try it.
**M9:** 2-5 min
**M10:** Just right
**M11:** Morning commute and procrastinating
**M12:** Streak and new story
**M13:** Yes, after I finish
**M14:** Friends only
**M15:** "It's like Wordle meets detective interrogation -- you pick alibis and a snarky AI judge decides if you're lying."
**M16:** Pretty accurate -- it's quick, daily-feeling, and KOA gives it that comic strip personality. The "comic strip" part is the KOA voice.
**M17:** More KOA personality moments. Let KOA roast you harder when you pick a lie. The character IS the game.
**M18:** The scoring math could be clearer in-game. I wasn't sure if "within 2" meant 2 below or 2 in either direction. Also, the rules say "6 alibi cards, 2 are lies" but I only play 3 -- what happens to the other 3? That felt slightly incomplete.

### Part 8: Run Log

**Puzzle 1: "The Power Outage"**
- Cards played: doorbell (T1), thermostat (T2), fitbit (T3)
- Verdicts: Truth, Truth, Truth
- Final score: 9/5
- Tier: FLAWLESS
- Hint usage: Yes -- identified after-11 PM cards as risky, avoided breaker_log specifically
- Reactive hint: Yes -- "basement feels off" confirmed my avoidance of basement cards
- Learned: The hint narrows the suspect pool significantly. Avoid the obvious trap.

**Puzzle 2: "The Thermostat War"**
- Cards played: doorbell (T1), light_lr (T2), phone (T3)
- Verdicts: Truth, Truth, Truth
- Final score: 10/7
- Tier: FLAWLESS
- Hint usage: Yes -- knew one living room card was a lie, played the odds on light_lr
- Reactive hint: Yes -- "closer to you" steered me away from smartwatch
- Learned: KOA's reactive hints are specific enough to identify the second lie if you listen carefully.

**Puzzle 3: "The Hot Tub Incident"**
- Cards played: smart_lock (T1), motion_hall (T2), fitbit (T3)
- Verdicts: Truth, Truth, Truth
- Final score: 11/8
- Tier: FLAWLESS
- Hint usage: Yes -- "protests too much" = spa_pump, "subtler" = water_meter. Avoided both.
- Reactive hint: Yes -- "lying about the evidence" confirmed a device was fabricating data
- Learned: Reading the hint flavor text carefully is the whole game. "Protests too much" was a dead giveaway.

### Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** Fresh scenarios with KOA's voice. If the writing stays this sharp and the puzzles stay clever, I'd open this app every morning like Wordle.
**F2:** Repetitive scenarios or if KOA's lines start feeling recycled. The character is the hook -- if the hook gets stale, I'm out.
**F3:** Show me the math more clearly after each turn. Like "doorbell: +4, total: 4/5" in a little scoreboard. I was doing mental math and almost lost track.
**F4:** This is genuinely fun. I played it on my commute and it was the perfect length. KOA's closing lines are the kind of thing I'd screenshot and text to friends. The "cat has no comment" line alone would sell this game. Please make this real.
