## PLAYTEST LOGS

### Puzzle 1: "The Power Outage"
**Target: 5**

**Opening Hint:** "One of the lies claims something happened after 11 PM. The other one? You're on your own."

**Pre-game thoughts:** The scenario is kinda funny — RIP the ranked match. Okay so one lie is after 11 PM. After-11 cards are fitbit (11:45), breaker_log (11:15), and motion_base (11:30). The breaker one sounds super sus but it's worth 5 points...

**Turn 1: breaker_log (Str 5)**
> YOU: "The breaker got reset at 11:15 — the smart panel logged it. That wasn't me. It reset itself."
> KOA: "Manually reset at 11:15 PM? The breaker was never touched. Nice try."
> **VERDICT: LIE. Score: 0 - 5 = -5**

**Reactive Hint:** "The breaker log is a fake. One down — the other lie? It's not after 11 PM. Check your earlier alibis."

Reaction: BRUH. I literally played the hint lie. The hint TOLD me one was after 11 PM and I played it anyway. I'm a clown. Okay so now I know the other lie is NOT after 11 PM — something earlier.

**Turn 2: motion_base (Str 4)**
> YOU: "The basement sensor says all-clear. No movement after 11. Nobody went down there."
> KOA: "Basement was quiet. Good. That's one less room KOA has to worry about."
> **VERDICT: TRUTH. Score: -5 + 4 = -1**

**Turn 3: doorbell (Str 4)**
> YOU: "I got home at 7. Check the doorbell cam — nobody else came in after me. It was just me all night."
> KOA: "Doorbell cam doesn't lie. Unlike some of these other devices."
> **VERDICT: TRUTH. Score: -1 + 4 = 3**

**Final Score: 3 / Target: 5 | Tier: CLOSE**
> KOA: "Almost convincing. Almost. The basement still has questions."

**Lie Reveal:** wifi_log (router data fabricated) and breaker_log (breaker never manually reset).

**Post-game:** UGH. I knew the breaker was sus and played it anyway. The wifi log being fake is sneaky — sounded so legit.

### Puzzle 2: "The Thermostat War"
**Target: 7**

**Opening Hint:** "One of the lies is from a sensor in the living room. The other one isn't."

**Pre-game thoughts:** LMAO the cat scenario is hilarious. "$412. Six pounds. No opposable thumbs." Okay — living room sensors are light_lr (5), motion_lr (4), temp_lr (3). One of those is a lie. One non-LR card is also a lie: phone (1), smartwatch (3), or doorbell (4).

**Turn 1: light_lr (Str 5)**
> YOU: "The living room was dark all night. Light sensor confirms it — no lamps, no screens, no one in there."
> KOA: "No lamps. The living room was dark and honest. KOA approves."
> **VERDICT: TRUTH. Score: 0 + 5 = 5**

**Reactive Hint:** "The light sensor is honest. But not every sensor in this house is — and I'm not just talking about the living room."

Reaction: Cool, light sensor is safe. "Not just talking about the living room" confirms one lie inside LR, one outside. I already knew that though.

**Turn 2: doorbell (Str 4)**
> YOU: "The hallway was empty after 12:30. Doorbell cam saw nothing. Nobody walked to the living room."
> KOA: "Nobody came in. So whoever did this was already here — and maybe closer to you than you think."
> **VERDICT: TRUTH. Score: 5 + 4 = 9**

At 9 now! Above target! Just need to not blow it...

**Turn 3: smartwatch (Str 3)**
> YOU: "My watch tracked my sleep. Unbroken light sleep at 2:15 AM. I didn't get up. I didn't touch the thermostat."
> KOA: "Light sleep at 2:15? Your watch begs to differ. So does KOA."
> **VERDICT: LIE. Score: 9 - 3 = 6**

**Final Score: 6 / Target: 7 | Tier: CLOSE**
> KOA: "Your story has holes. The living room has questions. And something personal doesn't add up."

**Lie Reveal:** smartwatch (sleep data fabricated) and motion_lr (living room motion sensor lied).

**Post-game:** NOOOOO. I was at 9!! I should have played phone (Str 1) — even if it was a lie I'd have been at 8. I literally talked myself out of the safe play because I wanted vibes. This is my villain origin story.

### Puzzle 3: "The Hot Tub Incident"
**Target: 8**

**Opening Hint:** "One of the lies flat-out denies something happened. It protests too much. The other one? Subtler."

**Pre-game thoughts:** $2,200 in water damage, lol. Okay — "protests too much" = something loudly denying. spa_pump says "no pump activation" when the hot tub obviously ran — that feels like protesting too much. "Subtler" = water_meter with its quiet "baseline 0.2 gal/hr" — sneaky. I think those two are the lies. Avoid them.

**Turn 1: motion_hall (Str 5)**
> YOU: "The hallway sensor didn't pick up anything. No one walked toward the back of the house. Not me, not anyone."
> KOA: "No hallway movement. Clean. But the deck didn't flood itself."
> **VERDICT: TRUTH. Score: 0 + 5 = 5**

**Reactive Hint:** "No movement in the hallway. Noted. But the real question isn't who walked — it's what the utilities recorded."

Reaction: "What the utilities recorded" — that's water_meter and spa_pump. Confirms my read.

**Turn 2: smart_lock (Str 4)**
> YOU: "The back door didn't open once. Zero unlock events from 10 PM to 6 AM. Nobody went outside. Period."
> KOA: "Zero unlocks. The back door stayed shut. So how did someone get to the deck...?"
> **VERDICT: TRUTH. Score: 5 + 4 = 9**

**Turn 3: thermostat (Str 3)**
> YOU: "The hallway held at 71 all night. If someone opened the back door, you'd see a temp drop. You don't."
> KOA: "Doors stayed closed, temp held steady. Your hallway is innocent. Your deck is not."
> **VERDICT: TRUTH. Score: 9 + 3 = 12**

**Final Score: 12 / Target: 8 | Tier: FLAWLESS**
> KOA: "Every alibi checks out. You told nothing but the truth. $2,200 in damages, though. KOA is billing you anyway."

**Lie Reveal:** water_meter (baseline usage fabricated) and spa_pump (pump definitely activated — protested too much).

**Post-game:** YESSSSS FLAWLESS!! I actually read the hint and used my brain this time. Correctly identified both lies. Turns out paying attention works??

**S37:** 6 — I wanted to know if my suspicions were right
**S38:** 8

### Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Among Us — because you're trying to figure out who's lying, and the social deduction / reading clues vibe is similar
**C2:** It's quicker and you can play solo. No need to get 10 friends online.
**C3:** No social element — Among Us is fun because of the chaos with friends. This is solo.
**C4:** "This game is basically Among Us but with cards and a sassy AI detective."

**E1:** Amused — the scenarios are funny

**E3:** Overwhelmed for a sec, then scanning for vibes

**E6:** P1: "oh no." P3: "let's GO"
**E7:** Useful — especially when it confirmed my suspicions
**E8:** More careful
**E9:** Tense — this is where I kept messing up
**E10:** P1: deflated. P2: frustrated. P3: euphoric
**E11:** "OHHH that makes sense"
**E12:** Would share P3 FLAWLESS for sure

### Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** P3 when the reactive hint said "what the utilities recorded" and I realized I'd correctly called both lies before even playing. That was my big brain moment.
**K2:** P2 reactive hint said "not just talking about the living room" which confirmed the non-LR lie existed, but I still picked wrong for T3. P3 reactive hint about "utilities" locked in my read.
**K3:** Getting FLAWLESS on P3 after two CLOSE results. Redemption arc completed.
**K4:** P2 Turn 3 — I was at 9, above target, and I CHOSE to play the smartwatch instead of the safe phone card. Self-inflicted wound.
**K5:** P1 Turn 1 — I hadn't processed the hint yet and just yolo'd the biggest card. That was pure gambling.
**K6:** "Every alibi checks out. You told nothing but the truth. $2,200 in damages, though. KOA is billing you anyway."
**K7:** No, the design felt fair. Every time I lost it was because I ignored info that was available to me.
**K8:** On first read, understanding that I pick 3 out of 6 cards and some are secretly lies took a second. But once I played T1 it clicked.

### Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** P1: no strategy, played the coolest-sounding card with the highest number. P2: tried to play high-value cards but still picked based on vibes for T3. P3: actually used the hint to eliminate suspected lies, then played safe high-value truths.
**L2:** P1: barely. P2: used it to categorize cards by location. P3: used it to identify which cards "protested too much" vs were "subtle" — correctly called both lies.
**L3:** Yes — P3's reactive hint ("what the utilities recorded") confirmed my suspicion about water_meter and spa_pump, so I confidently avoided them for T2 and T3.
**L4:** Lies tend to be the cards that directly contradict the scenario's central event. The breaker log denying the breaker was touched, the motion sensor denying movement in the room where something happened, the pump denying activation when the tub overflowed. They protest too much.
**L5:** Actually read and use the opening hint from Turn 1. Don't play the biggest number card just because it's big. If I'm already above target, play the LOWEST strength card to minimize risk.
**L6:** There's a real strategy — use the hints to narrow down lies, avoid them, and manage your risk based on the score gap. But you also need to read each puzzle's flavor.

### Part 7: Product & Market Fit

**M1:** Daily puzzle
**M2:** 1-2 weeks, maybe month+ if scenarios stay fresh and funny
**M3:** Free+ads, maybe $1-2 if I'm hooked
**M4:** Daily puzzles and new characters
**M5:** Tolerable
**M6:** Phone app
**M7:** Only FLAWLESS or funny KOA lines
**M8:** If I showed them a funny KOA line or got FLAWLESS and wanted to flex
**M9:** 2-5 min
**M10:** Just right
**M11:** Procrastinating — literally playing this during lecture rn
**M12:** Push notification or friend shared
**M13:** Yes, after I solve it — don't spoil me
**M14:** Friends only leaderboard
**M15:** "It's like a quick crime puzzle where you pick alibis and a sassy AI judges if you're lying"
**M16:** Kinda? The comic strip part fits because of the funny scenarios and KOA's personality. The daily puzzle part fits the format. But it's more like "daily puzzle meets interrogation scene."
**M17:** More KOA personality and funnier scenarios. The writing is already good — lean into it harder.
**M18:** Nope, felt clean. Maybe explain the hint system a tiny bit more upfront — I wasted P1 because I didn't realize how useful the opening hint was.

### Part 8: Run Log

**Puzzle 1: "The Power Outage"**
- Cards: breaker_log (T1), motion_base (T2), doorbell (T3)
- Verdicts: LIE, TRUTH, TRUTH
- Score: -5 + 4 + 4 = 3 / Target: 5
- Tier: CLOSE
- Hint usage: Saw it said "after 11 PM" but ignored it and played breaker_log anyway
- Reactive hint help: Yes — told me other lie was NOT after 11 PM, so I played safe after-11 cards
- Learned: Actually read the hint before playing. Don't yolo the biggest card.

**Puzzle 2: "The Thermostat War"**
- Cards: light_lr (T1), doorbell (T2), smartwatch (T3)
- Verdicts: TRUTH, TRUTH, LIE
- Score: 5 + 4 - 3 = 6 / Target: 7
- Tier: CLOSE
- Hint usage: Used it to know one LR sensor and one non-LR card were lies. Played light_lr and it was safe.
- Reactive hint help: Somewhat — confirmed the structure but I still picked the wrong T3 card
- Learned: When you're above target, play the LOWEST strength card to minimize downside risk. Don't get greedy.

**Puzzle 3: "The Hot Tub Incident"**
- Cards: motion_hall (T1), smart_lock (T2), thermostat (T3)
- Verdicts: TRUTH, TRUTH, TRUTH
- Score: 5 + 4 + 3 = 12 / Target: 8
- Tier: FLAWLESS
- Hint usage: Used "protests too much" to identify spa_pump as a lie, "subtler" to identify water_meter. Avoided both.
- Reactive hint help: Yes — "what the utilities recorded" confirmed both suspected lies were utility devices
- Learned: The hints are the whole game. Use them.

### Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** New scenarios every day with KOA being funny. The writing carries this game hard. If the scenarios stay creative and KOA stays sassy, I'd make it a daily habit.
**F2:** Repetitive scenarios or if I figured out a formula that makes every puzzle feel the same. Also if KOA's lines got recycled.
**F3:** Make the opening hint a TINY bit more obvious for first-time players. I wasted P1 not understanding how important it was. Maybe highlight it or have KOA say "pay attention to this" the first time.
**F4:** This is genuinely fun? Like I expected to be bored and I got invested. The scenarios are funny, KOA has real personality, and the feeling of going from CLOSE to FLAWLESS across three puzzles was a legit progression arc. The P2 moment where I was at 9 and threw it away will haunt me. Good game.
