## PUZZLE 1: "The Power Outage"

### Reading the scenario

Ok so... the breaker tripped, house went dark, gaming PC died mid-match. Oof, that sucks. I was supposedly upstairs the whole time but someone was in the basement. KOA wants to know if my story checks out. Got it.

### Reading the hint

> "One of the lies claims something happened after 11 PM. The other one? You're on your own."

Ok so avoid the ones that mention after 11 PM. Let me scan... fitbit is 11:45 PM, breaker_log is 11:15 PM, motion_base is "after 11 PM." So those three are suspicious. One of them is a lie. Cool, I'll try to avoid those.

### Looking at the hand

Ooh, breaker_log is strength 5 — that's the biggest one. And motion_base and doorbell are both 4s. The target is only 5 so I don't need to go crazy. Three truths at like 3+ each would crush it.

I'm drawn to the big numbers but the hint says watch out for after-11 stuff. Let me go with the safe early-evening ones.

### Turn 1: Playing `doorbell` (str 4)

I'm picking doorbell. Strength 4, it's at 7 PM which is way before 11, and doorbell cams are like... reliable? Feels safe. Let's go.

**Narration:** "I got home at 7. Check the doorbell cam — nobody else came in after me. It was just me all night."

**Verdict:** TRUTH. +4. Running score: **4**

**KOA:** "Doorbell cam doesn't lie. Unlike some of these other devices."

Ha! Ok good start. KOA's sassy, I like it.

**Reactive hint:** "Front door checks out. But something in the basement feels off — and not just the breaker."

Hmm, something in the basement. So basement stuff is sketchy. The basement cards are... wifi_log and breaker_log. Ok noted, avoid basement stuff.

### Turn 2: Playing `breaker_log` (str 5)

Wait but... breaker_log is strength 5 and I only need 1 more point to hit target. But KOA just said the basement feels off. Hmm. But also breaker_log is the BIGGEST card and if it's true I'm golden. The hint said after 11 PM is sus, and breaker_log is 11:15 PM so... actually maybe I should avoid it.

Ok ok ok, let me play thermostat instead. Strength 2, bedroom, 9 PM. Safe location, safe time. Boring but safe.

Actually wait. I need 1 more point. Thermostat is 2, that gets me to 6 which clears. Let me just do that.

**Playing `thermostat` (str 2)**

**Narration:** "The thermostat went to night mode at 9. Nobody touched it after. I was in bed."

**Verdict:** TRUTH. +2. Running score: **6**

**KOA:** "Thermostat checks out. The bedroom was cozy and honest."

Nice! I'm at 6, target is 5. I'm already cleared! Turn 3 is just bonus now.

### Turn 3: Playing `breaker_log` (str 5)

Ok I'm already cleared so let me swing big. Breaker_log, strength 5. YOLO. If it's true I get a huge score. KOA said basement is off but I'm already safe so whatever.

**Narration:** "The breaker got reset at 11:15 — the smart panel logged it. That wasn't me. It reset itself."

**Verdict:** LIE. -5. Running score: **6 - 5 = 1**

**KOA:** "Manually reset at 11:15 PM? The breaker was never touched. Nice try."

OH NO. That tanked me! I went from cleared to... 1?? Target was 5. I'm at 1. That's BUSTED.

Wait. I... I was safe. I was CLEARED. And then I got greedy. Ugh.

### Final Outcome

**Score: 1 / Target: 5**
**Tier: BUSTED** (below by more than 2)

**KOA:** "The basement has more stories than a library. And half of them don't check out."

**Lie reveal:** breaker_log (str 5) and wifi_log (str 3) were lies.

Wow. I literally threw that away. If I'd just played fitbit or something safe for Turn 3 I would have been fine. That's so annoying. But also kind of my fault? Lesson learned: don't get greedy when you're already winning.

## PUZZLE 2: "The Thermostat War"

### Reading the scenario

HAHA ok someone cranked the thermostat to 85 at 2 AM, $412 energy bill, and the cat's been blamed. The cat weighs six pounds. I love this already. KOA would like a word. Same.

### Reading the hint

> "One of the lies is from a sensor in the living room. The other one isn't."

Ok so one lie is living room, one isn't. Living room cards are... light_lr, motion_lr, and temp_lr. One of those three is a lie. And then one non-living-room card is also a lie. The non-living-room ones are phone, smartwatch, and doorbell.

### Looking at the hand

Target is 7 this time. That's higher. I need big cards. light_lr is 5, motion_lr and doorbell are 4, smartwatch and temp_lr are 3, phone is 1.

To hit 7 I probably need like 5 + 4 + something, or at least avoid lies. The hint says one living room sensor is lying. light_lr is the biggest living room card at 5... but bigger number doesn't mean it's more likely to be a lie, right? Hmm.

I don't want to overthink this. Let me start with something I feel good about.

### Turn 1: Playing `light_lr` (str 5)

Big number, living room. The hint says ONE living room card is a lie but there are three living room cards, so 2 out of 3 are fine. I'll take those odds. And if it hits, I'm halfway to 7 already.

**Narration:** "The living room was dark all night. Light sensor confirms it — no lamps, no screens, no one in there."

**Verdict:** TRUTH. +5. Running score: **5**

**KOA:** "No lamps. The living room was dark and honest. KOA approves."

Yes! Big points. KOA approves and so do I.

**Reactive hint:** "The light sensor is honest. But not every sensor in this house is — and I'm not just talking about the living room."

So not every sensor is honest, and not just living room. So something outside the living room is also sketchy. That tracks with the hint — one lie is living room, one isn't. I already cleared one living room card so the living room lie is still out there (motion_lr or temp_lr). And something personal is off too.

### Turn 2: Playing `doorbell` (str 4)

I need 2 more to clear. Doorbell is strength 4, it's at the front door — not living room, not personal. Feels safe. Doorbell cams worked well for me in P1.

**Narration:** "The hallway was empty after 12:30. Doorbell cam saw nothing. Nobody walked to the living room."

**Verdict:** TRUTH. +4. Running score: **9**

**KOA:** "Empty hallway. Nobody came in. Which means whoever did this was already here."

Ok I'm at 9, target is 7. Cleared again! Let me not be dumb this time. Do NOT play a lie card.

### Turn 3: Playing `phone` (str 1)

You know what, I learned my lesson from P1. I'm playing the safest, smallest card. Phone, strength 1. Even if it's a lie I only lose 1 point and I'm still at 8 which clears. Playing it safe this time.

**Narration:** "My phone was dead to the world after 12:30. Zero screen time. I wasn't up scrolling — I was sleeping."

**Verdict:** TRUTH. +1. Running score: **10**

**KOA:** "Phone was off. KOA respects a good night's sleep. Allegedly."

Haha, "allegedly." Love it.

### Final Outcome

**Score: 10 / Target: 7**
**Tier: CLEARED** (not flawless — I played 0 lies but... wait, did I play 0 lies? Let me think. light_lr = truth, doorbell = truth, phone = truth. Yeah, 0 lies!)

Actually wait — FLAWLESS is target + 0 lies. I hit both!

**Tier: FLAWLESS!**

**KOA:** "Your alibis are airtight. The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment."

HAHA the cat has no comment. That's amazing. I'm screenshotting that.

**Lie reveal:** motion_lr (str 4) and smartwatch (str 3) were lies.

Oh wow, I almost played smartwatch at one point. And motion_lr was the living room lie. Glad I dodged both.

## PUZZLE 3: "The Hot Tub Incident"

### Reading the scenario

Hot tub ran all night, deck is flooded, $2,200 in water damage. No timer on the hot tub. Someone turned it on. I was "in bed." Ok this one sounds expensive and bad.

### Reading the hint

> "One of the lies flat-out denies something happened. It protests too much. The other one? Subtler."

Hmm, "protests too much." So one lie is like aggressively denying something. Let me look at the cards... spa_pump says "jets confirmed OFF — no activation events overnight." That's a pretty strong denial given the deck is literally flooded. That feels like it protests too much. I'm gonna avoid that one.

The "subtler" one is harder to spot. Could be anything.

### Looking at the hand

Target is 8. That's the highest yet. Cards: fitbit 2, thermostat 3, water_meter 3, spa_pump 5, smart_lock 4, motion_hall 5.

To hit 8 I need big cards. motion_hall is 5 and spa_pump is 5 but I think spa_pump is the "protests too much" one. So motion_hall at 5 feels like a must-play. smart_lock at 4 is solid too. That's 9 if both are true. Then anything else for Turn 3.

### Turn 1: Playing `motion_hall` (str 5)

Big card, hallway location, motion sensor. The hint talks about protesting too much and being subtle — a hallway motion sensor just says "no movement" which is pretty neutral. Not protesty. Going for it.

**Narration:** "The hallway sensor didn't pick up anything. No one walked toward the back of the house. Not me, not anyone."

**Verdict:** TRUTH. +5. Running score: **5**

**KOA:** "No hallway movement. Clean. But the deck didn't flood itself."

Ok good, 5 points. Need 3 more.

**Reactive hint:** "No movement in the hallway. Noted. But the real question isn't who walked — it's what the utilities recorded."

Utilities... so the utility-related cards are suspicious. Water_meter is from UTILITY location. And spa_pump is the smart pump. Those sound like utilities. Hmm. I was already avoiding spa_pump. Maybe water_meter is the subtle lie? It claims baseline usage but the deck is flooded — that doesn't add up either actually.

### Turn 2: Playing `smart_lock` (str 4)

Smart lock, back door, strength 4. It says zero unlock events. That's not a utility, it's a lock. The hint pointed at utilities. This feels safe. If it's true I'm at 9 which clears.

**Narration:** "The back door didn't open once. Zero unlock events from 10 PM to 6 AM. Nobody went outside. Period."

**Verdict:** TRUTH. +4. Running score: **9**

**KOA:** "Zero unlocks. The back door stayed shut. So how did someone get to the deck...?"

Ha, good question KOA. I'm at 9, target 8. Cleared! Ok Turn 3, let me be smart again.

### Turn 3: Playing `thermostat` (str 3)

Playing thermostat, strength 3. Hallway location, not a utility device. If it's true I get 12. If it's a lie I get 6 which is below target... hmm. Actually let me think about what's safe.

The lies are the "protests too much" one (spa_pump I think) and a subtle one (maybe water_meter based on the reactive hint about utilities). Thermostat is a temperature sensor in the hallway — it just says temp held steady. That feels honest and low-key.

Wait, if thermostat is a lie I drop to 6 and that's BUSTED. Let me play fitbit instead — strength 2. If it's a lie I'm at 7 which is CLOSE (within 1 of target 8). If it's true I'm at 11.

Actually no, I'll just go thermostat. It doesn't feel like either lie description — it's not protesting too much and it's not really subtle in a sneaky way. It's just... a thermostat.

**Playing `thermostat` (str 3)**

**Narration:** "The hallway held at 71 all night. If someone opened the back door, you'd see a temp drop. You don't."

**Verdict:** TRUTH. +3. Running score: **12**

**KOA:** "Doors stayed closed, temp held steady. Your hallway is innocent. Your deck is not."

### Final Outcome

**Score: 12 / Target: 8**
**Lies played: 0**
**Tier: FLAWLESS!**

**KOA:** "Every alibi checks out. You told nothing but the truth. $2,200 in damages, though. KOA is billing you anyway."

Hahaha KOA is billing me anyway. Classic.

**Lie reveal:** spa_pump (str 5) and water_meter (str 3) were lies.

Called it! Spa_pump was totally the "protests too much" card. And water_meter was the subtle one — baseline usage with a flooded deck? Yeah right. The reactive hint about utilities really helped there.

## Part 3: Comparisons & Open-Ended

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most?
Wordle — it's that same "daily puzzle with a share moment" vibe. You get a limited number of guesses, there's a reveal at the end, and you want to talk about it with people.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than Wordle?
The character and story. Wordle is just letters — this has KOA roasting you, funny scenarios about cats and hot tubs, and you feel like you're IN something. Way more personality.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than Wordle?
Simplicity. Wordle I can explain in 10 seconds. This has strength values, truth/lie math, hints, reactive hints, tiers — it's a lot more to hold in your head. On a commute with coffee I had to re-read things.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically **Wordle** but with **a sassy AI detective judging your alibi choices**."

**E5:** Hearing your character "speak" the narration: Fun, like I'm acting
**E6:** Getting the Turn 1 verdict from KOA: Relief (or dread in P1 T3)
**E7:** Hearing the reactive hint: "Ohhh ok ok ok"
**E8:** Choosing Turn 2: More calculated
**E9:** Choosing Turn 3: Either cocky or cautious depending on score
**E10:** Seeing the final outcome and tier: Elation (P2/P3) or "NOOO" (P1)
**E11:** Reading the lie reveal: "I KNEW it" or "oh wow I dodged that"
**E12:** Seeing the share card: "I need to screenshot the KOA line"

---

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!" across all 3 puzzles?
P1 Turn 3 when I played breaker_log while already cleared and it tanked my score from 6 to 1. That was a huge "oh NO" moment that taught me the core lesson of the game — don't be greedy.

**K2:** Was there a moment where the hint or reactive hint changed your mind about a card? Describe it.
Yes — P3 when the reactive hint said "it's what the utilities recorded." I was already suspicious of spa_pump from the opening hint, but the reactive hint made me also suspect water_meter, which I might have played otherwise. I chose thermostat instead.

**K3:** What was the most satisfying moment across all 3 puzzles?
Getting FLAWLESS on P2 and reading "The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment." I literally wanted to screenshot that.

**K4:** What was the most frustrating moment across all 3 puzzles?
Busting on P1 because I got greedy on Turn 3. I was CLEARED and threw it away. But honestly it was a good kind of frustrating — I knew it was my fault.

**K5:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing, with no real information to go on? When?
Turn 1 of P1 felt a bit guess-y. The hint told me to avoid after-11 PM cards but I still had 3 other cards to choose from and no way to distinguish them. I just went with "doorbell cams are reliable" vibes.

**K6:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"The cat remains a suspect. The cat has no comment." Also loved "KOA is billing you anyway" from P3.

**K7:** Did you ever feel tricked by the game (not by the lies — by the DESIGN)? When?
Not really tricked, but P1 felt rough because the game lets you keep playing even after you've cleared, and that Turn 3 greed trap got me. But that's... kind of the point? It teaches you to be careful.

**K8:** What was the most confusing thing about the game?
Understanding that lie cards SUBTRACT. My brain wanted to think "oh it's a lie, so it just doesn't count." The fact that it actively removes points makes the risk way higher than I initially thought.

---

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Did it change across puzzles?
P1: Pick a big safe-looking card. P2: Same but more intentional about what the hint was narrowing down. P3: Deliberately picked the biggest card that didn't match the lie description. Yeah, it evolved from "vibes" to "actually thinking about the hint."

**L2:** How did you use KOA's opening hint? Walk through your reasoning for any puzzle.
P3: The hint said one lie "protests too much" — flat-out denies something happened. I looked at the cards and spa_pump literally says "jets confirmed OFF" when the deck is flooded. That's a loud denial. So I avoided it. That worked.

**L3:** Did the reactive hint after Turn 1 actually help? Give an example or say "not really."
Yes! P3's reactive hint about "what the utilities recorded" pointed me away from water_meter, which turned out to be the subtle lie. Without that I might have played it.

**L4:** Did you notice any pattern across puzzles about what makes a card a lie?
High-strength cards seem more likely to be lies? Both puzzles had a strength-5 lie. Also the lies tend to be the ones that conveniently explain away the most damning evidence.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
NEVER play a risky card when I'm already above target. P1 taught me that the hard way. Also read the hint more carefully before Turn 1 — I skimmed it in P1 and paid more attention by P3.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it more about reading each puzzle?
A bit of both. The general strategy is: use the hint to eliminate suspects, play safe Turn 1, use the reactive hint to narrow further, and don't get greedy. But each puzzle's hint requires its own reading.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

### Format Preference
**M1:** (c) Both — daily puzzles plus a story mode

**M2:** (b) 1-2 weeks

### Monetization
**M3:** (c) I'd pay $1-2 one-time

**M4:** (a) New daily puzzles and (e) Story campaigns

**M5:** (b) Tolerable if short

### Distribution
**M6:** (a) Phone (iOS/Android app)

**M7:** (b) Only if I got FLAWLESS or a funny KOA line

**M8:** The KOA lines. If KOA said something hilarious I'd screenshot it and send it. The share moment isn't the score — it's the roast.

### Session Length
**M9:** (b) 2-5 minutes

**M10:** (b) Just right

### Retention & Habit
**M11:** (a) Morning routine (commute, coffee) and (e) Procrastinating

**M12:** (b) Friend shared their result and (d) New story content dropped

### Competitive & Social
**M13:** (a) Yes, after I've played — like Wordle comparisons

**M14:** (d) Only among friends, not global

### Identity
**M15:** "It's like Wordle but you're being interrogated by a snarky AI about whether you broke your own house."

**M16:** "Daily puzzle meets comic strip" is pretty close. The comic strip part is KOA's personality for sure. I'd lean more into the comic strip vibe — the scenarios are already funny, lean into that. It does feel accurate.

**M17:** More KOA personality variety. Different moods, callbacks to previous puzzles, maybe KOA remembers if you got busted yesterday. Make it feel like an ongoing relationship, not just a game system.

**M18:** The subtraction mechanic is brutal and not immediately obvious. I thought "lie = no points" not "lie = NEGATIVE points." Maybe the briefing should really hammer that home with an example because it completely changes how risky each play is.

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
If KOA had different moods or reactions based on my history. Like if KOA remembered I got BUSTED yesterday and brought it up. That recurring relationship would keep me coming back more than the puzzles alone.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the scenarios started feeling samey. "Someone did X, you say you were in bed" can only go so many ways. The scenarios need to stay weird and funny — hot tubs, cats, gaming PCs. Keep it specific and absurd.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing about this game, what would it be?
Make the subtraction mechanic clearer upfront. Maybe show a quick visual example in the briefing: "Truth +3, Lie -3, NOT zero." That one thing would have changed my entire P1 approach.

**F4:** Any other thoughts, reactions, or feedback?
I genuinely had fun. The KOA lines are the star of the show — protect those at all costs. The puzzle mechanics are solid but what makes this shareable is KOA being funny. Also, the three-puzzle arc of "get wrecked, learn, dominate" felt really satisfying even if P1 was painful. That's good design. One more thing: I love that the scenarios are domestic and silly, not like murder mysteries. It makes the whole thing feel lighter and more my speed.
