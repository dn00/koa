**Player:** Jen, 22, college student
**Date:** 2026-01-27
**Context:** Sitting in a boring econ lecture, phone under the desk. Professor is talking about supply elasticity. I do not care.

## PUZZLE 1: "The Power Outage"

### Scenario Reaction

Ok so the breaker tripped, house went dark, gaming PC died mid-ranked-match... LOL that's actually tragic. I would literally cry. "Someone was in the basement" — ooh spooky vibes. KOA has questions. KOA sounds like that one friend who always plays detective at parties. I'm into it.

### Opening Hint

> "One of the lies claims something happened after 11 PM. The other one? You're on your own."

Ok so something after 11 PM is a lie. Let me look at the cards... *scrolls through* ... the fitbit is 11:45 PM, the breaker log is 11:15 PM, and the motion sensor is after 11 PM. So one of those three is a lie. Cool cool. I'll just... avoid those I guess? Or not. Some of these have cool flavor text.

### Hand Overview

Looking at these cards. The doorbell one is kinda boring — "you arrived home at 7 PM." Like ok?? The wifi log one about the gaming PC dying is SO relatable though. Fitbit heart rate dropping — that's a mood. The breaker log is "it reset itself" which sounds sketchy as hell honestly. The motion sensor is "all-clear, no movement" — the basement is giving horror movie.

### TURN 1

Ok I'm going with **doorbell** (str 4). "I got home at 7. Check the doorbell cam — nobody else came in after me. It was just me all night." That's such a vibe. It's like the opening line of a true crime podcast. Also strength 4 is pretty good right? I think?

**YOU:** "I got home at 7. Check the doorbell cam — nobody else came in after me. It was just me all night."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. +4 to score.
**Score:** 4 / 5

**KOA:** "Doorbell cam doesn't lie. Unlike some of these other devices."

Ooh shade. KOA is already throwing shade at my other cards. Love that.

**Reactive Hint:** "Front door checks out. But something in the basement feels off — and not just the breaker."

Something in the basement feels off... ok so the basement cards are sus? Let me check... wifi_log is basement, breaker_log is basement. The motion sensor is also basement. Hmm. Ok I'll try to avoid basement stuff maybe? But also I only half-registered that because my professor just said "this will be on the exam" and I panicked for 0.3 seconds.

### TURN 2

I need 1 more point to hit target 5. The thermostat is str 2, that would get me to 6 if it's true. And the narration is "The thermostat went to night mode at 9. Nobody touched it after. I was in bed." That sounds cozy and honest. It's in the bedroom, not the basement, so that tracks with what KOA said. Going with **thermostat** (str 2).

**YOU:** "The thermostat went to night mode at 9. Nobody touched it after. I was in bed."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. +2 to score.
**Score:** 6 / 5

Ok nice I already hit the target! One more turn though.

### TURN 3

Ok I'm already past 5 so I'm cleared no matter what unless I pick a lie with high strength. Remaining cards: wifi_log (3, basement), fitbit (3, 11:45 PM), breaker_log (5, 11:15 PM), motion_base (4, 11:30 PM).

The hint said one lie is after 11 PM. KOA said the basement is sus. The breaker_log is BOTH basement AND after 11 PM (11:15 PM). That's gotta be a lie right? So I'll avoid that one.

Honestly the fitbit narration is funny — "Check my Fitbit. Heart rate dropped to resting by 11:45. I was asleep. End of story." Lol "end of story." That's such a dramatic way to say you were sleeping. But it's after 11 PM so it might be the lie...

You know what, the motion sensor says "all-clear, no movement after 11" — that's also after 11 PM. But KOA said the basement motion sensor is honest in the reactive hint... wait no, KOA said "something in the basement feels off." Ugh I wasn't really paying attention.

I'll just go with **fitbit** (str 3). It's not in the basement and even if it's a lie, 6 - 3 = 3... wait that would be below target. Hmm. Ok whatever. The narration is funny. YOLO.

**YOU:** "Check my Fitbit. Heart rate dropped to resting by 11:45. I was asleep. End of story."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. +3 to score.
**Score:** 9 / 5

### FINAL OUTCOME

**Tier: CLEARED**
**Final Score: 9 / 5 (target)**
**Lies played: 0**

Wait — 0 lies and I got CLEARED not FLAWLESS? Oh wait, FLAWLESS is target + 0 lies. I think I qualify for FLAWLESS actually! Let me re-read... "FLAWLESS (target + 0 lies)." I hit target AND played 0 lies. That's FLAWLESS!

**Tier: FLAWLESS**

**KOA:** "Every alibi checks out. Not a single lie. Your gaming PC died for nothing. Go back to bed."

LMAOOO "your gaming PC died for nothing." KOA really said RIP your ranked match. I love this AI.

**Lie Reveal:**
- breaker_log (str 5): LIE — "Manually reset at 11:15 PM? The breaker was never touched. Nice try."
- wifi_log (str 3): LIE — "The router doesn't lie — oh wait. It literally just did."

Oh interesting, the wifi log was a lie too? The router data was fabricated? That's actually wild. I dodged both lies by accident basically. The basement thing from KOA's hint kinda helped but honestly I mostly just picked cards with fun narration.

## PUZZLE 2: "The Thermostat War"

### Scenario Reaction

LMAOOO the cat has been blamed. THE CAT WEIGHS SIX POUNDS AND DOES NOT HAVE OPPOSABLE THUMBS. I'm screaming. This is the best scenario. $412 energy bill because someone cranked it to 85 at 2 AM??? In AUGUST??? That's unhinged. "You were 'sleeping.'" The quotation marks around sleeping are sending me.

KOA would like a word. KOA always wants a word. KOA is that friend.

### Opening Hint

> "One of the lies is from a sensor in the living room. The other one isn't."

Ok so one lie is living room, one isn't. Living room cards are... light_lr, motion_lr, and temp_lr. So one of those three is a lie. And then one non-living-room card is also a lie. The non-living-room cards are phone, smartwatch, and doorbell.

Honestly this is a lot of thinking. My professor just made eye contact with me. Pretending to take notes.

### TURN 1

Ok vibes check on the narrations. The phone one is boring — "zero screen time after 12:30." The smartwatch one — "unbroken light sleep at 2:15 AM, I didn't get up" — that's very "trust me bro" energy. The doorbell — "hallway was empty after 12:30" — ok sure. The light sensor — "the living room was dark all night" — atmospheric. The motion sensor — "the motion sensor saw nothing between 1 and 3 AM. The room was empty. Ask the sensor." LOL "ask the sensor." That's giving attitude.

I'm going with **motion_lr** (str 4) because "Ask the sensor" is such a power move line. The motion sensor is my ride or die.

**YOU:** "The motion sensor in the living room saw nothing between 1 and 3 AM. The room was empty. Ask the sensor."

**KOA Verdict:** LIE. -4 to score.
**Score:** -4 / 7

**KOA:** "No presence detected? KOA detected LIES. The motion sensor is a fraud."

NOOOOO. "The motion sensor is a fraud." KOA really called my card a fraud. I'm at -4. This is bad. This is very bad.

**Reactive Hint:** "The motion sensor lied. One down. The other lie? It's not in the living room. Check what was on your person."

Ok so the other lie is NOT in the living room and it's something "on your person." That's... the phone or the smartwatch. Those are the personal items. One of those is a lie. I need to avoid both of those AND play high-strength truth cards to recover from -4. Target is 7 so I need 11 more points in 2 turns. Max I can get is... light_lr (5) + doorbell (4) = 9, which would put me at 5. That's not enough. Or temp_lr (3) + light_lr (5) = 8, putting me at 4. Still not enough.

Wait actually I'm cooked no matter what aren't I? Even if both remaining cards are truths, the best I can do is 5 + 4 = 9, so -4 + 9 = 5, which is below 7. Ugh. Ok whatever let's just play for vibes then.

### TURN 2

Going with **light_lr** (str 5) because it's the highest strength and "The living room was dark all night. Light sensor confirms it" sounds legit. KOA said the other lie isn't in the living room, so this should be safe.

**YOU:** "The living room was dark all night. Light sensor confirms it — no lamps, no screens, no one in there."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. +5 to score.
**Score:** 1 / 7

**KOA:** "No lamps. The living room was dark and honest. KOA approves."

Ok cool, truth. But I'm at 1 and I need 7. Not happening.

### TURN 3

Remaining: phone (1), smartwatch (3), doorbell (4), temp_lr (3). KOA said the other lie is "on your person" — phone or smartwatch. The doorbell (4) is the safest bet then. Let me play **doorbell** (str 4).

**YOU:** "The hallway was empty after 12:30. Doorbell cam saw nothing. Nobody walked to the living room."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. +4 to score.
**Score:** 5 / 7

### FINAL OUTCOME

**Tier: CLOSE** (within 2 of target)
**Final Score: 5 / 7**
**Lies played: 1 (motion_lr)**

**KOA:** "Your story has holes. The living room has questions. And something personal doesn't add up."

Ugh. "Something personal doesn't add up." That's the smartwatch isn't it.

**Lie Reveal:**
- motion_lr (str 4): LIE — "No presence detected? KOA detected LIES. The motion sensor is a fraud."
- smartwatch (str 3): LIE — "Light sleep at 2:15? Your watch begs to differ. So does KOA."

I KNEW the smartwatch was sus after KOA's hint. But I already played the motion sensor first because I liked the narration. The "ask the sensor" attitude was a trap. I got baited by a sassy motion sensor. This is my villain origin story.

## PUZZLE 3: "The Hot Tub Incident"

### Scenario Reaction

THE HOT TUB RAN ALL NIGHT. JETS ON FULL. COVER OFF. $2,200 IN WATER DAMAGE. This game keeps escalating and I'm here for it. First the gaming PC, then the energy bill, now the entire back deck is flooded. "The hot tub doesn't have a timer. Someone turned it on." KOA IS NOT AMUSED. Neither would I be honestly.

Ok I need to actually try this time. I got FLAWLESS on P1 by vibes alone and got wrecked on P2 because I played the sassy card first. Let me at least glance at the hint.

### Opening Hint

> "One of the lies flat-out denies something happened. It protests too much. The other one? Subtler."

"Protests too much." Ok so one lie is aggressively denying something. Let me look at the narrations...

- fitbit: "I was in REM sleep from 1 to 5 AM. Four straight hours." — that's pretty chill
- thermostat: "If someone opened the back door, you'd see a temp drop. You don't." — that's kinda defensive but not crazy
- water_meter: "That's baseline. If the tub was running, you'd see a spike. There's no spike." — this is protesting a LOT. "There's no spike" when the deck is literally underwater? That's sus.
- spa_pump: "The pump log says the jets were off all night. No activation events. Whatever flooded the deck, it wasn't the hot tub." — THIS ONE. "Whatever flooded the deck, it wasn't the hot tub." THE DECK IS FLOODED FROM THE HOT TUB. That's PROTESTING TOO MUCH.
- smart_lock: "Zero unlock events. Nobody went outside. Period." — "Period" is kinda aggressive but ok
- motion_hall: "No one walked toward the back of the house. Not me, not anyone." — defensive but not crazy

Ok so spa_pump is definitely the "protests too much" one. It literally denies the hot tub did anything when the deck is FLOODED FROM THE HOT TUB. I'm avoiding that one for sure.

The "subtler" lie is harder. Hmm. Not sure. Whatever, let me just not play spa_pump and I should be ok.

Target is 8 this time. That's high. I need to play big strength truths.

### TURN 1

motion_hall (str 5) has the highest strength along with spa_pump (5). And the narration is clean — "No one walked toward the back of the house" feels believable. It's in the hallway, not the deck. Going with **motion_hall** (str 5).

**YOU:** "The hallway sensor didn't pick up anything. No one walked toward the back of the house. Not me, not anyone."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. +5 to score.
**Score:** 5 / 8

**KOA:** "No hallway movement. Clean. But the deck didn't flood itself."

"The deck didn't flood itself." KOA is so passive aggressive I love it.

**Reactive Hint:** "No movement in the hallway. Noted. But the real question isn't who walked — it's what the utilities recorded."

"What the utilities recorded." Utilities... water_meter is a utility. Spa pump is on the deck. Thermostat is kinda a utility? This is pointing me toward the utility stuff being sus. That tracks with my spa_pump theory. And maybe water_meter too? The water meter is from the "UTILITY" location literally.

### TURN 2

I need 3 more points minimum. smart_lock (str 4) would get me to 9 which clears. "The back door didn't open once. Zero unlock events." That sounds solid. It's a lock, not a utility. Going with **smart_lock** (str 4).

**YOU:** "The back door didn't open once. Zero unlock events from 10 PM to 6 AM. Nobody went outside. Period."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. +4 to score.
**Score:** 9 / 8

**KOA:** "Zero unlocks. The back door stayed shut. So how did someone get to the deck...?"

Ooh that's creepy. The door never opened but the deck flooded??? Spooky.

### TURN 3

I'm at 9, target is 8, I'm already cleared! Remaining: fitbit (2), thermostat (3), water_meter (3), spa_pump (5).

I'm pretty sure spa_pump is a lie (str 5, would drop me to 4 = BUSTED). Water_meter might be the subtle lie (str 3, would drop me to 6 = CLOSE). Let me play something safe. fitbit (2) or thermostat (3). Even if one of them is a lie, 9 - 3 = 6 which is CLOSE, and 9 - 2 = 7 which is also CLOSE. Hmm.

Actually neither of those is a lie if spa_pump and water_meter are the lies. So both fitbit and thermostat should be safe. Going with **thermostat** (str 3) for the extra points. "The hallway held at 71 all night" — cozy and honest vibes.

**YOU:** "The hallway held at 71 all night. If someone opened the back door, you'd see a temp drop. You don't."

**KOA Verdict:** TRUTH. +3 to score.
**Score:** 12 / 8

### FINAL OUTCOME

**Tier: FLAWLESS** (hit target + 0 lies played)
**Final Score: 12 / 8**
**Lies played: 0**

**KOA:** "Every alibi checks out. You told nothing but the truth. $2,200 in damages, though. KOA is billing you anyway."

LMAOOO KOA IS BILLING ME ANYWAY. Even when you win KOA is petty. Iconic behavior.

**Lie Reveal:**
- spa_pump (str 5): LIE — "Jets confirmed OFF? The flooded deck would like a word. So would KOA."
- water_meter (str 3): LIE — "0.2 gallons per hour? The deck is underwater. Math isn't your strong suit."

CALLED IT. Both of them! The "protests too much" hint was so good — spa_pump was literally like "it wasn't the hot tub" while the deck was underwater. And the water_meter was the "subtler" one because it just quietly lied about the numbers. I actually used the hint this time and it worked!!

## Part 3: Comparisons & Open-Ended

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most?
Among Us — because you're trying to figure out who (or what) is lying, and there's this social deduction energy even though you're playing solo. The "sus" vibes are real.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than Among Us?
The writing is way better. Among Us is fun because of your friends being chaotic, but this game has KOA who is genuinely funny on its own. You don't need friends to make it entertaining. Also each round is way faster.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than Among Us?
No social element. Among Us is funny because your friend is lying to your face and you're screaming at each other. This is just me vs an AI. It's fun but it's lonely.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically **Among Us** but with **a sarcastic AI detective and you're the one being interrogated.**"

---

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!" across all 3 puzzles?
P3 when I read the spa_pump narration — "Whatever flooded the deck, it wasn't the hot tub" — and realized that was OBVIOUSLY the "protests too much" lie from the hint. It clicked instantly and I felt so smart.

**K2:** Was there a moment where the hint or reactive hint changed your mind about a card? Describe it.
P2 — after I played motion_lr and got wrecked, the reactive hint said "the other lie is not in the living room, check what was on your person." That immediately told me smartwatch or phone was the other lie. I avoided both for the rest. Didn't save me from losing but I understood the system better.

**K3:** What was the most satisfying moment across all 3 puzzles?
Getting FLAWLESS on P3 after actually using the hint properly. Going from vibes-only (P1) to getting wrecked (P2) to actually thinking and winning (P3) felt like a real arc.

**K4:** What was the most frustrating moment across all 3 puzzles?
P2 Turn 1 — playing motion_lr because "ask the sensor" sounded cool and immediately going to -4. I was mathematically eliminated after one card. That felt rough.

**K5:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing, with no real information to go on? When?
P1 Turn 1 — I had no reactive hint yet and the opening hint only narrowed down one lie to "after 11 PM" which was 3 cards. So I was mostly guessing. But it felt fine because I was just getting started.

**K6:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Your gaming PC died for nothing. Go back to bed." and "$2,200 in damages, though. KOA is billing you anyway." Both FLAWLESS closers. KOA is petty even when you win and that's what makes it great.

**K7:** Did you ever feel tricked by the game (not by the lies — by the DESIGN)? When?
P2 felt a little unfair because starting at -4 made it impossible to clear. But honestly I played the wrong card first so that's on me. The design didn't trick me, my vibes did.

**K8:** What was the most confusing thing about the game?
The math when you play a lie. Subtracting strength from your score is intuitive in theory but when I'm at -4 trying to figure out if I can still win, my brain checked out. I just went "ok I'm cooked" and played for fun.

---

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Did it change across puzzles?
P1: Pick whatever sounds coolest. P2: Same thing (and got punished). P3: Actually read the hint first and picked a safe high-strength card. So yes, it changed dramatically. Pain is a good teacher.

**L2:** How did you use KOA's opening hint? Walk through your reasoning for any puzzle.
P3: The hint said "one lie protests too much." I read all the narrations and spa_pump literally said "it wasn't the hot tub" about a hot tub flood. That's protesting too much. So I avoided it. Then for the "subtler" lie, KOA's reactive hint pointed me toward utilities, so I avoided water_meter too. First time I actually used the system properly.

**L3:** Did the reactive hint after Turn 1 actually help? Give an example or say "not really."
P2 — the reactive hint literally told me "the other lie is on your person" which narrowed it to phone or smartwatch. Super helpful. I just wish I'd gotten it BEFORE I played a lie.

**L4:** Did you notice any pattern across puzzles about what makes a card a lie?
The lies tend to be the cards that claim nothing happened or deny the obvious. Like the spa pump denying the hot tub was on. Or the motion sensor saying nobody was there. The liars protest or deny.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Actually read the hint FIRST before picking Turn 1. Use the hint to narrow down lies, then pick the highest-strength card that's probably safe. Don't pick cards just because the narration sounds cool. ...Ok I'd probably still pick based on narration sometimes.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it more about reading each puzzle?
There's definitely a strategy — use the hint to eliminate suspects, play safe high-strength cards. But each puzzle's hint works differently so you have to actually read and think about it. It's not just one formula.

(d) Only among friends, not global

### Identity
**M15:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
"It's like if Among Us was a solo detective game and the AI roasting you is the best part."

**M16:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets comic strip." Does that feel accurate? Why or why not?
Kinda? The "comic strip" part fits because KOA's personality carries the experience like a comic character would. But it doesn't feel like a newspaper comic — it feels more like a TikTok skit or a visual novel moment. "Daily puzzle meets interrogation TikTok" is more accurate for me.

**M17:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
Shareable moments. Let me screenshot or share a card with KOA's verdict line overlaid on it. The writing is already there — just make it easy to share the funniest lines. That's how this spreads.

**M18:** Is there anything about this game that felt broken, unfair, or confusing that we haven't asked about?
P2 felt kinda rough because one bad Turn 1 pick made it mathematically impossible to clear. Maybe there could be a way to recover from a bad first turn — like a "KOA gives you a second chance" mechanic or the target adjusts slightly. But also the pain of P2 is what made me actually learn for P3, so maybe it's fine? I dunno. It worked out narratively.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle 1: "The Power Outage"
- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): doorbell, thermostat, fitbit
- Verdicts (Truth/Lie per turn): Truth, Truth, Truth
- Final score / target: 9 / 5
- Tier: FLAWLESS
- Did you use the hint? How? Barely. Noted "after 11 PM" = lie but mostly picked by vibes.
- Did the reactive hint help? How? Kinda — it said "basement feels off" which made me avoid basement cards for T2, but I didn't really analyze it.
- One sentence — what did you learn? You can win on vibes alone if you're lucky, but that's not a strategy.

### Puzzle 2: "The Thermostat War"
- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): motion_lr, light_lr, doorbell
- Verdicts (Truth/Lie per turn): Lie, Truth, Truth
- Final score / target: 5 / 7
- Tier: CLOSE
- Did you use the hint? How? Registered "one lie is living room" but still played a living room card first because the narration was funny.
- Did the reactive hint help? How? Yes — it told me the other lie was "on your person" so I avoided phone and smartwatch for T2 and T3.
- One sentence — what did you learn? Don't pick cards just because the flavor text sounds cool — actually cross-reference with the hint first.

### Puzzle 3: "The Hot Tub Incident"
- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): motion_hall, smart_lock, thermostat
- Verdicts (Truth/Lie per turn): Truth, Truth, Truth
- Final score / target: 12 / 8
- Tier: FLAWLESS
- Did you use the hint? How? Yes — "protests too much" immediately flagged spa_pump. Avoided it and water_meter (utility, subtle lie).
- Did the reactive hint help? How? Yes — "what the utilities recorded" confirmed my suspicion about water_meter being the subtle lie.
- One sentence — what did you learn? Actually reading the hint and matching it to the narrations makes you feel like a genius.

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
New scenarios that are as funny as the thermostat war. The humor is the hook. If every scenario makes me laugh, I'm coming back. Also KOA needs to stay petty — that personality is everything.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the scenarios get repetitive or if KOA's lines start feeling copy-pasted. The second it feels formulaic, I'm out. Also if there's no social element — no sharing, no comparing with friends — it'll feel lonely and I'll drift.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing about this game, what would it be?
Add a TikTok/Instagram share format. A vertical card with the scenario title, your tier, and the best KOA line from your run. That's it. The game markets itself if the quotes are shareable.

**F4:** Any other thoughts, reactions, or feedback? Say whatever you want here.
KOA is genuinely one of the funniest game characters I've encountered and it's literally just an AI investigator in a smart home. The scenarios are absurd in the best way — a six-pound cat being blamed for a $412 energy bill is comedy gold. The game taught me to actually pay attention to hints by making me fail first, which is honestly great design even though I was salty about P2 for like 30 seconds. I would 100% play this on my phone during lectures. Please make this an app. Also the cat should be a recurring character. Thank you.
