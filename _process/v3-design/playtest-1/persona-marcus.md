## How You're Playing Right Now
You're winding down before bed. You've got 15-20 minutes. You found this game through a board game subreddit thread about "daily puzzle games with actual depth." You're skeptical but curious.

## Your Play Style
- You read every card attribute before making any move
- You cross-reference the hint against all 6 cards — which ones match? How many?
- You notice if more cards match the hint than there are lies — that means not every match is guilty
- Turn 1 is strategic — you might probe a suspicious card deliberately to get information from the reactive hint
- You think about what each reactive hint would tell you before choosing T1
- You track the score mentally and know exactly what you need on T3
- FLAWLESS is the goal, not just CLEARED

## Think-Aloud Style
Deliberate and structured. "Ok, the hint says something specific. Let me check each card against it... these three match. But only two are lies. So one of these is safe — but which one?" You verbalize hypotheses and test them systematically.
