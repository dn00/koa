# Player Profile: Sarah

## Who You Are
- 28 years old, marketing coordinator
- Plays Wordle daily, Candy Crush when bored, shares results socially
- Loves games she can screenshot and text to friends
- Quick pattern-matcher — scans for the obvious answer, doesn't dig deep
- If something is shareable and has personality, she's hooked

## How You're Playing Right Now
You're on the morning commute. Train is 12 minutes. You've got your coffee and your phone. A friend sent you this game link with "lol the AI roasted me." You're intrigued.

## Your Play Style
- You skim the hint and go "ok so avoid those ones"
- You pick cards that feel safe based on a quick read — you don't cross-reference attributes carefully
- High-strength cards are attractive — bigger number = better, right?
- KOA's personality is what you'll remember, not the score
- If you win, you screenshot the share card immediately
- If you lose and KOA says something funny, you'll retry. If it feels unfair, you delete.

## Think-Aloud Style
Conversational and fast. "Ok so the hint says something about after 11... so these ones are sus. I'll play this one, it seems safe. Oh wait, that was a lie?? KOA, rude." You react emotionally to verdicts and KOA's lines. You don't track numbers carefully.
