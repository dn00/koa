## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale)

### Engagement
- **S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away. **6** - I immediately started calculating the optimal line post-mortem
- **S2:** I felt tension when choosing which cards to pair. **5** - Moderate tension, though I wish I had more certainty
- **S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened. **4** - The scenario is a frame, not a story
- **S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently. **7** - Already did the full analysis
- **S5:** I lost track of time while playing. **3** - I was deliberately tracking my moves

### Clarity
- **S6:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing. **6** - Clear enough, though pressure rules needed re-reading
- **S7:** I understood what KOA's opening hint was telling me. **5** - I understood the 10PM-1AM part, missed the full implication
- **S8:** The scoring (truth adds, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive. **6** - Straightforward math
- **S9:** I understood the combo system (bonuses only if both cards are truths). **7** - Very clear
- **S10:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result. **7** - The math is transparent

### Pairing & Combos
- **S11:** Choosing which cards to pair felt like a real decision (not obvious). **6** - Multiple viable strategies
- **S12:** I thought about combo bonuses when selecting my pairs. **7** - Central to my decision-making
- **S13:** Pairing two cards felt like making an argument, not just selecting options. **4** - Mechanically yes, thematically somewhat
- **S14:** I considered the risk that a lie in my pair would cancel combos. **7** - Core tension
- **S15:** I understood why some pairs scored higher than others. **7** - Transparent scoring

### Deduction
- **S16:** The opening hint helped me identify which cards might be lies. **5** - Partially, I misread the second pattern
- **S17:** The reactive hints after Turns 1 and 2 changed how I played. **4** - Too late to matter much
- **S18:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing. **5** - Somewhere in between
- **S19:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling." **5** - Sometimes
- **S20:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction. **6** - Time was key, type less so

### Difficulty
- **S21:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge. **5** - One bad T2 pick doomed me
- **S22:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair). **4** - I made mistakes but the penalty was harsh
- **S23:** Being forced to play at least 1 lie felt fair (not punishing). **6** - Good design constraint

### KOA (the investigator character)
- **S24:** KOA felt like a real character, not just a game system. **4** - Functional but not memorable
- **S25:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny. **3** - Generic detective lines
- **S26:** I enjoyed the back-and-forth with KOA. **4** - Mildly entertaining
- **S27:** KOA's responses to my pairs influenced my thinking. **5** - The reveals did, the flavor less so
- **S28:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score). **5** - For information extraction
- **S29:** I wanted to "beat" KOA - it felt personal. **4** - Not really, it's a puzzle not a rivalry

### Narration & Immersion
- **S30:** The pair narration (combined argument) added to the experience. **5** - Nice flavor, not essential
- **S31:** Playing a pair felt like presenting evidence, not just selecting cards. **5** - Thematically coherent
- **S32:** The game felt like an interrogation scene. **4** - Light theming
- **S33:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning. **3** - I wanted to win, not prove innocence
- **S34:** I read the full narration each time (not just the card IDs and scores). **6** - First time, yes
- **S35:** KOA's reaction to my argument (before the reveal) added tension. **4** - Mild anticipation

### Achievement & Tiers
- **S36:** Winning felt earned, not lucky. **N/A** - I lost
- **S37:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED. **6** - Once I saw the tier system
- **S38:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully. **5** - Good goal structure
- **S39:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost). **7** - Very educational
- **S40:** I cared about which specific cards were lies, not just my score. **7** - Essential for learning

### Net Promoter Score
- **S41:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend? **6** - Needs more play to know if depth is real

## Part 3: Comparisons & Open-Ended

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most?
**Poker / Bluffing games** - The core loop is risk management under uncertainty with partial information. You're not bluffing, but you're reading hidden information and managing risk/reward.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked in C1?
Single-player, bounded session length, deterministic puzzle structure. You can "solve" a specific puzzle with perfect play in theory.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked in C1?
Less depth in opponent modeling (KOA is a system, not an opponent), no long-term metagame evolution, no adaptation to your playstyle.

**C4:** Complete this sentence:
"This game is basically **Mastermind** but with **thematic dressing and combo optimization**."

## Part 4: Emotional Journey

- **E1:** Reading the scenario for the first time: Curious, analytical
- **E2:** Reading KOA's opening hint: Alert, marking mental notes
- **E3:** Looking at your hand of 8 cards: Calculating, scanning for patterns
- **E4:** Choosing your Turn 1 pair: Uncertain, gathering info
- **E5:** Hearing your character present the combined argument: Skimmed
- **E6:** Hearing KOA react to your argument (before the reveal): Impatient
- **E7:** Getting the Truth/Lie reveal and score: "Okay, data point collected"
- **E8:** Seeing combos fire (or get cancelled): Disappointed (T1), Very disappointed (T2), Satisfied (T3)
- **E9:** Hearing the reactive hint: Mildly helpful
- **E10:** Choosing Turn 2 pair: Confident (wrongly)
- **E11:** Choosing Turn 3 pair: Hopeful, calculated
- **E12:** Seeing the final outcome and tier: Frustrated but engaged
- **E13:** Reading the lie reveal: "AH - toolbox was the lie!" - educational
- **E14:** Seeing the share card: Skipped mentally

---

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"?
The lie reveal showing toolbox was a lie. I had narrowed to toolbox OR floodlight for the 3rd lie, picked wrong (played motion_yard which I thought was safe). The post-mortem analysis of "10PM-1AM = 2 lies, nothing happened = 1 lie" was the real aha.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a hint or reactive hint changed your mind about a card?
KOA's opening hint about "10 PM - 1 AM" made me suspicious of cards in that window. But partner_testimony was in that window and was truth, so the hint wasn't absolute.

**K3:** Was there a moment where you wanted a combo but feared a lie would cancel it?
Yes - Turn 3. I wanted the full TESTIMONY combo (Reinforcement + Corroboration + Timeline) but partner_testimony was in the suspicious time window. I took the risk and it paid off.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Turn 3's +19 with all three combos firing. Proof that I understood the combo system.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Turn 2 playing motion_yard and losing 6 points. I thought BACKYARD/SENSOR would be safe since it was outside the 10PM-1AM window. The "nothing happened" pattern was the trap I fell into.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing, with no real information to go on?
Turn 1 felt more like information gathering than deduction. The hint gave a time window but with 5 cards outside that window and only 1-2 lies there, it wasn't definitive.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you?
"Zero connections after eleven? Then who sent 16 pages to the printer at 3 AM - the ghost of emails past?" - Decent flavor, pointed to the lie logic.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the game (not by the lies - by the DESIGN)?
Slightly. motion_yard's timestamp was 3:00 AM (outside the warned 10PM-1AM window) but was a lie. The hint implied that window was suspicious, so cards OUTSIDE seemed safer. The "two patterns" hint needed to be stronger.

**K9:** What was the most confusing thing about the game?
The pressure system (HIGH STRENGTH, TYPE ECHO) felt like an afterthought. I tracked it but it didn't significantly impact my decisions.

---

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 pairing strategy.
Information gathering. I paired the two lowest-strength DIGITAL cards from the same location (OFFICE) to test if same-type/same-location cards correlated with lies. Low risk if wrong.

**L2:** How did you use KOA's opening hint?
Flagged email_log (11:30 PM), toolbox (11:15 PM), and partner_testimony (12:30 AM) as suspicious. But only avoided toolbox - I played email_log T1 (mistake) because I wanted to test DIGITAL cards.

**L3:** Did you try to maximize combos?
Yes, Turn 3 was pure combo optimization. Turn 2 I tried for Coverage (different types) but the lie canceled it.

**L4:** Did you consider pairing 2 suspected lies together to contain the damage?
Yes! But only 3 lies exist and I couldn't identify all 3 with certainty. Pairing 2 suspected lies together is high-risk if one is actually truth (you lose combo bonus).

**L5:** Did the reactive hints actually help?
Not significantly. "Both from the late-night window. Bold move - or reckless" after T1 confirmed the time-window pattern but I'd already burned a card. "Playing it safe?" after T2 was too vague.

**L6:** Did you notice anything about what makes a card a lie vs. a truth?
Post-mortem: 2 lies in the 10PM-1AM window, 1 lie with a "nothing happened" claim. The patterns were: time correlation AND narrative implausibility (claims contradicting the 3AM print job).

**L7:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
- T1: Play the two TESTIMONY cards for maximum combo value and both are outside or just on edge of suspicious window
- T2: Play PHYSICAL + SENSOR avoiding the 10PM-1AM cards specifically
- T3: Dump the low-strength suspected lie (email_log) with a high-strength truth

**L8:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it more about reading each puzzle?
Both. General strategy: front-load your safest high-combo pairs, save suspected lies for last when you can pair them with high-strength truths to minimize damage. Puzzle-specific: read the hints carefully, look for multiple patterns.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

### Format Preference
**M1:** (c) Both - daily puzzles plus a story mode. Daily for habit, story for depth.

**M2:** (d) As long as puzzles stay fresh. If the patterns become predictable, I'll stop.

### Monetization
**M3:** (d) I'd pay $3-5 one-time. Depends on content volume.

**M4:** (a) New daily puzzles and (d) Harder difficulty modes. Not interested in cosmetics or story.

**M5:** (a) Fine, expected for a free game.

### Distribution
**M6:** (a) Phone (iOS/Android app). Quick sessions fit mobile.

**M7:** (b) Only if I got FLAWLESS or a funny KOA line. Need something worth sharing.

**M8:** What would make you tell a friend about this game?
"It's like a daily logic puzzle but you're building alibis. 3 minutes, satisfying when you solve it, annoying when you don't."

### Session Length
**M9:** (c) 5-10 minutes - I was analyzing heavily, might be 2-5 for experienced play.

**M10:** (b) Just right. Maybe slightly long for a daily puzzle.

### Retention & Habit
**M11:** (b) Lunch break, (c) Waiting / killing time, (e) Procrastinating

**M12:** (d) New story content dropped or (a) Push notification if streak system exists.

### Competitive & Social
**M13:** (a) Yes, after I've played - like Wordle comparisons. Want to see if others found the pattern.

**M14:** (d) Only among friends, not global. Global leaderboards attract degenerate optimization.

### Identity
**M15:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
"Daily deduction puzzle where you're caught lying and have to pick which lies to own."

**M16:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets interrogation scene." Does that feel accurate?
Puzzle: Yes. Interrogation: Superficially. KOA doesn't adapt to your plays, doesn't bluff, doesn't pressure you dynamically. It's more "daily puzzle with interrogation theming."

**M17:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
Puzzle variety that requires genuinely different strategies. If every puzzle is "read the hint, avoid suspicious cards, maximize combos," it becomes formulaic. Need puzzles where the optimal play is counterintuitive.

**M18:** Is there anything about this game that felt broken, unfair, or confusing?
The Objection mechanic: KOA challenged motion_yard AFTER revealing it was a lie. That made the choice trivial (withdraw vs. stand by a known lie). If the Objection came BEFORE the T2 reveal, it would create real tension.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Today's Puzzle: "The Midnight Print Job"
- **Pairs played:** T1: browser_history + email_log, T2: workbench + motion_yard, T3: partner_testimony + neighbor_testimony
- **Verdicts per card:** browser_history(T), email_log(L), workbench(T), motion_yard(L), partner_testimony(T), neighbor_testimony(T)
- **Combos triggered:** T1: None (cancelled), T2: None (cancelled), T3: Corroboration +3, Timeline +2, Reinforcement +3
- **Final score / target:** 14/20
- **Tier:** BUSTED
- **Cards left unplayed:** toolbox (LIE - good dodge!), floodlight (TRUTH - points left on table)
- **Did you use the hint?** Yes, flagged 10PM-1AM cards as suspicious. Partially effective.
- **Did the reactive hints help?** Marginally. Confirmed the time-window pattern but didn't reveal the "nothing happened" pattern.
- **One sentence - what did you learn?** The hint indicates WHERE lies cluster, not that ALL cards in that zone are lies; look for multiple overlapping patterns.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Puzzle variety with meaningfully different structures. Leaderboards among friends. Occasional "hard mode" puzzles that reward precise play.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
Predictable patterns across puzzles. If "avoid the time window mentioned in hint + avoid 'nothing happened' claims" solves every puzzle, I'm done.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing about this game, what would it be?
Move The Objection to BEFORE the Turn 2 reveal. Currently it's after, which makes it trivial if KOA challenges a revealed lie. Put it before the reveal and you're gambling on your own read.

**F4:** Any other thoughts, reactions, or feedback?
The core loop is solid. Risk management under uncertainty with partial information is a proven formula. The execution needs:
1. Hint system that's instructive but not solvable in one read
2. Puzzle variety that doesn't become formulaic
3. KOA personality that's memorable (currently generic)
4. Pressure mechanics that matter more (I barely thought about them)

I'd play another puzzle. I want to see if my pattern recognition was correct or if I got lucky/unlucky. That desire to "test my theory" is a good sign for retention.

Score: 6/10 for a first session. Potential for 8/10 if depth is real.
