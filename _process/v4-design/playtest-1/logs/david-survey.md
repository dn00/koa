## Part 3: Comparisons & Open-Ended

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
**Ace Attorney** - The interrogation vibe, presenting evidence to prove a point, the feeling of "wait, does this evidence actually hold up?" It's like the cross-examination segments but compressed into a puzzle format.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked in C1?
Respects my time. Ace Attorney is great but it's 40+ hours. This gave me that "figuring out the contradiction" feeling in under 10 minutes. The combo risk-reward adds a layer Ace Attorney doesn't have - there, you just present the right evidence. Here, you're gambling on pairs.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked in C1?
Character depth. Ace Attorney has ridiculous memorable witnesses, prosecutors with personalities. KOA is interesting but it's one entity. The scenario is just "you did a thing, prove you didn't." Less narrative stakes.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Wordle but with deduction and bluffing mixed in."

## Part 4: Emotional Journey

Map your emotional state at each point (one word or short phrase per line):

**E1:** Reading the scenario for the first time: Curious
**E2:** Reading KOA's opening hint: Intrigued - trying to decode it
**E3:** Looking at your hand of 8 cards: Overwhelmed at first, then analytical
**E4:** Choosing your Turn 1 pair: Cautious
**E5:** Hearing your character present the combined argument: Amused - nice touch
**E6:** Hearing KOA react to your argument (before the reveal): Tense
**E7:** Getting the Truth/Lie reveal and score: Grimace - email_log was a lie, ouch
**E8:** Seeing combos fire (or get cancelled): Frustrated - combo canceled
**E9:** Hearing the reactive hint: Neutral - trying to parse it
**E10:** Choosing Turn 2 pair: Confident - played it safe
**E11:** Choosing Turn 3 pair: Second-guessing myself constantly
**E12:** Seeing the final outcome and tier: Disappointed but fair
**E13:** Reading the lie reveal: "Ohhhh" - now I see it
**E14:** Seeing the share card: Would actually share this

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If no such moment, say "none."
When I saw the final lie reveal and realized motion_yard was the lie, not floodlight. The clues were there - motion_yard claimed to log a specific cat event at 11:20 PM which was probably fabricated to seem legitimate. Floodlight just said "nothing happened" which is actually easier to verify as true.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a hint or reactive hint changed your mind about a card? Describe it.
KOA's opening hint about "10 PM to 1 AM" made me suspicious of everything in that window. I correctly avoided some lies but it also made me distrust things I shouldn't have. The "not the only thing bothering me" was helpful - I knew something outside the window was also bad.

**K3:** Was there a moment where you wanted a combo but feared a lie would cancel it? What did you do?
Absolutely. motion_yard + floodlight would have been a huge combo (same location, same type = +6 bonus). I was terrified one was a lie. I ended up avoiding it... and ironically, floodlight was truth. I could have gotten massive points if I'd paired floodlight with partner_testimony.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Turn 2 hitting both truths and the Coverage combo firing. Felt like I'd earned it through careful play.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
The TYPE ECHO pressure on Turn 3. I didn't fully account for it in my planning. Using PHYSICAL and TESTIMONY again cost me -2, which combined with the lie put me at 0 for the turn.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing, with no real information to go on? When?
Turn 3 felt 50/50. I had narrowed it down - I knew 2 lies were in the remaining 4 cards - but I couldn't definitively tell which. I made a logical guess (toolbox in the suspicious window) that was correct, but picked the wrong SENSOR card.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Asleep on the couch but you know the exact state of your toolbox. Interesting." - This was before the reveal and it made me sweat. Good writing.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the game (not by the lies - by the DESIGN)? When?
The TYPE ECHO pressure mechanic felt slightly unfair because it punishes you for using the same evidence types across turns, but sometimes you have to based on what's left. Not broken, just adds complexity I wasn't fully tracking.

**K9:** What was the most confusing thing about the game?
Initially, understanding how lies subtract (strength - 1). Had to read it twice. Also the pressure mechanics (HIGH STRENGTH and TYPE ECHO) - I only really noticed TYPE ECHO when it hit me.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 pairing strategy. Why those two cards first?
I accidentally picked browser_history + email_log just to see how the game worked. They were both DIGITAL from OFFICE in the late-night window. Honestly, I was still learning. Would pick differently knowing what I know now.

**L2:** How did you use KOA's opening hint? Walk through your reasoning.
"10 PM to 1 AM doesn't sit right" - I flagged email_log (11:30 PM), toolbox (11:15 PM), and partner_testimony (12:30 AM) as suspicious. browser_history (10:45 PM) was borderline. "Not the only thing bothering me" told me at least one lie was outside this window. I suspected floodlight for being too clean.

**L3:** Did you try to maximize combos? How did lie risk factor into that?
Yes. I specifically considered motion_yard + floodlight for the +6 combo (same type + same location). But I thought floodlight was a lie, so I avoided it. This was wrong - it was motion_yard that lied.

**L4:** Did you consider pairing 2 suspected lies together to contain the damage? Why or why not?
Briefly. If I paired toolbox + motion_yard (both suspected lies), worst case is -3 + -6 = -9. Too much damage. The math doesn't work out - better to pair a suspected truth with a suspected lie and hope you're wrong about the lie.

**L5:** Did the reactive hints actually help? Give an example or say "not really."
Sort of. KOA said "Both from the late-night window. Bold move - or reckless." after Turn 1. That confirmed my suspicion about the time window. But the hints after Turn 2 ("Playing it safe?") felt more like commentary than information.

**L6:** Did you notice anything about what makes a card a lie vs. a truth?
Lies seem to be evidence that would be suspicious if true - like the email log claiming no activity when clearly someone printed docs at 3 AM. But motion_yard tricked me because it seemed plausible (cat at 11:20, then nothing). The fabricated detail (the specific cat event) was actually the tell - it was too specific.

**L7:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Avoid TYPE ECHO pressure by planning my evidence types across all three turns. Consider that overly specific details might be fabricated lies. Trust KOA's hints more literally.

**L8:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it more about reading each puzzle?
Both. There's a meta-strategy (manage pressure, don't combo with risky cards, understand the hint structure) but each puzzle requires reading the specific clues and scenario.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

### Format Preference
**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
**(c) Both** - daily puzzles plus a story mode. Daily for the quick hit, story for when I have more time.

**M2:** If this were a daily puzzle, how many days in a row would you realistically play before stopping?
**(c) A month or more** - if the puzzles stay fresh and interesting.

### Monetization
**M3:** Would you pay for this game? (pick the highest you'd consider)
**(d) I'd pay $3-5 one-time** - for a full game with good content.

**M4:** What would make a subscription worth it?
**(e) Story campaigns** - followed by new daily puzzles. Leaderboards and characters are nice-to-have.

**M5:** How would you feel about ads between puzzles?
**(d) I'd pay to remove them** - ads would kill the interrogation vibe.

### Distribution
**M6:** Where would you most want to play this?
**(a) Phone (iOS/Android app)** - perfect for waiting rooms, commutes.

**M7:** Would you share your results? (like Wordle's grid)
**(b) Only if I got FLAWLESS or a funny KOA line** - "tissue paper alibi" is quotable.

**M8:** What would make you tell a friend about this game?
"It's like Wordle met Ace Attorney in a waiting room." Short, deduction-based, feels clever without being time-consuming. If a friend likes puzzle games or detective stuff, I'd mention it.

### Session Length
**M9:** How long did the puzzle FEEL like it took?
**(b) 2-5 minutes** - felt right.

**M10:** Was that the right length?
**(b) Just right** - perfect for idle time.

### Retention & Habit
**M11:** When would you most likely play this? (pick all that apply)
**(a) Morning routine (commute, coffee)**
**(c) Waiting / killing time**
**(e) Procrastinating**

**M12:** What would bring you BACK after a week away?
**(d) New story content dropped** - also (a) push notification would work.

### Competitive & Social
**M13:** Would you want to see how friends solved the same puzzle?
**(a) Yes, after I've played - like Wordle comparisons**

**M14:** Would a daily leaderboard motivate you?
**(d) Only among friends, not global** - global feels sweaty.

### Identity
**M15:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
"You're interrogated by your smart home AI and have to figure out which of your alibis are lies before you present them."

**M16:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets interrogation scene." Does that feel accurate? Why or why not?
Yes, that's accurate. It captures the daily-puzzle vibe (short, one-shot, shareable) and the interrogation tension (KOA's commentary, presenting evidence, the reveal). The only thing it undersells is the deduction/strategy layer.

**M17:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
More varied KOA personalities or scenarios. The mechanics are solid - now it needs variety to keep me coming back. Different investigators with different hint styles, different scenario types (not just "prove you didn't do X").

**M18:** Is there anything about this game that felt broken, unfair, or confusing that we haven't asked about?
The pressure mechanics (HIGH STRENGTH and TYPE ECHO) weren't super clear upfront. I got hit by TYPE ECHO and it felt like a gotcha. Maybe show a preview of what pressure penalties would apply before confirming your pick?

## Part 8: Run Log

### Today's Puzzle: "The Midnight Print Job"
- Pairs played (T1, T2, T3): [browser_history + email_log], [workbench + neighbor_testimony], [toolbox + partner_testimony]
- Verdicts per card (Truth/Lie): browser_history(T), email_log(L), workbench(T), neighbor_testimony(T), toolbox(L), partner_testimony(T)
- Combos triggered (or cancelled): T1 - Coverage cancelled by lie; T2 - Coverage +2 fired; T3 - Coverage cancelled by lie
- Final score / target: 13/20
- Tier: BUSTED
- Cards left unplayed: motion_yard (LIE - good dodge!), floodlight (TRUTH - left points on table)
- Did you use the hint? How? Yes - "10 PM to 1 AM" made me suspicious of cards in that window. Correctly dodged email_log (well, after playing it T1) and flagged toolbox. Missed that motion_yard's specific detail (cat at 11:20) was fabricated.
- Did the reactive hints help? How? Somewhat. KOA's "Bold move - or reckless" confirmed the time window was risky. "Playing it safe?" didn't change my play.
- One sentence - what did you learn? Overly specific details in alibis might be fabricated to seem legitimate, and you have to track pressure penalties across the whole game.

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with interesting premises. Not just "prove you didn't print the docs" but variety - different crimes, different relationships to KOA, different stakes.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
Same-feeling puzzles. If the hint structure is always "time window + one other thing," I'd figure out the meta and it would stop being interesting.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing about this game, what would it be?
Show pressure penalties (TYPE ECHO, HIGH STRENGTH) as a preview before you confirm your pick. Let me see "Warning: This pair would trigger TYPE ECHO -2" so I can factor it in strategically.

**F4:** Any other thoughts, reactions, or feedback? Say whatever you want here.
I went in skeptical - most mobile games are hollow. This has actual depth. The deduction feels real, the risk/reward on combos is interesting, and KOA has personality. Lost my first game but immediately wanted to try again to see if I could crack the pattern. That's a good sign. The "must play at least 1 lie" constraint is elegant design - forces meaningful decisions instead of just avoiding all risk. Would genuinely recommend this to puzzle-game friends.

The dentist can wait - I want to try another puzzle.
