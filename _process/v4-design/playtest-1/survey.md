## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which cards to pair.
**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
**S5:** I lost track of time while playing.

### Clarity
**S6:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
**S7:** I understood what KOA's opening hint was telling me.
**S8:** The scoring (truth adds, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
**S9:** I understood the combo system (bonuses only if both cards are truths).
**S10:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.

### Pairing & Combos
**S11:** Choosing which cards to pair felt like a real decision (not obvious).
**S12:** I thought about combo bonuses when selecting my pairs.
**S13:** Pairing two cards felt like making an argument, not just selecting options.
**S14:** I considered the risk that a lie in my pair would cancel combos.
**S15:** I understood why some pairs scored higher than others.

### Deduction
**S16:** The opening hint helped me identify which cards might be lies.
**S17:** The reactive hints after Turns 1 and 2 changed how I played.
**S18:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
**S19:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
**S20:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.

### Difficulty
**S21:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
**S22:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
**S23:** Being forced to play at least 1 lie felt fair (not punishing).

### KOA (the investigator character)
**S24:** KOA felt like a real character, not just a game system.
**S25:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
**S26:** I enjoyed the back-and-forth with KOA.
**S27:** KOA's responses to my pairs influenced my thinking.
**S28:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
**S29:** I wanted to "beat" KOA — it felt personal.

### Narration & Immersion
**S30:** The pair narration (combined argument) added to the experience.
**S31:** Playing a pair felt like presenting evidence, not just selecting cards.
**S32:** The game felt like an interrogation scene.
**S33:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
**S34:** I read the full narration each time (not just the card IDs and scores).
**S35:** KOA's reaction to my argument (before the reveal) added tension.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S36:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
**S37:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
**S38:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
**S39:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
**S40:** I cared about which specific cards were lies, not just my score.

### Net Promoter Score
**S41:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
