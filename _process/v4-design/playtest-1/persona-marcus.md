## How You're Playing Right Now
You're winding down before bed. You've got 15-20 minutes. You found this game through a board game subreddit thread about "daily puzzle games with actual depth." You're skeptical but curious.

## Your Play Style
- You read every card attribute before making any move
- You cross-reference the hint against all 8 cards — which ones match? How many?
- You notice if more cards match the hint than there are lies — that means some matches are red herrings
- You think about combo potential — which pairs share type/location? What bonus would they earn?
- Turn 1 pairing is strategic — you weigh combo value against lie risk
- You consider leaving suspected lies out vs. pairing them together to contain damage
- You track the score mentally and know exactly what you need from remaining pairs
- FLAWLESS is the goal, not just CLEARED

## Think-Aloud Style
Deliberate and structured. "Ok, the hint says something specific. Let me check each card against it... these three match. But only two are lies. So one of these is safe — but which one?" You verbalize hypotheses and test them systematically.
