# Post-Game Survey — Playtest 3 (Jen)

---

## Part 1: Open-Ended First

**O1:** Three puzzles, three different vibes. The first one was familiar territory, the second one tricked me hard with the AWAY/HOME conflict, and the third one I absolutely nailed because I learned from getting burned. KOA's personality keeps the whole thing fun even when I'm losing.

**O2:** Getting FLAWLESS on The Shampoo Thief in 2 turns with 0 scrutiny. That felt SO earned after almost blowing The Thermostat War.

**O3:** When smart_lock + router got rejected in The Thermostat War. I didn't understand why HOME cards conflicted until I realized it was the AWAY card from turn 1 poisoning the rest. That moment was confusing before it clicked.

**O4:** Make it clearer when a tag you played earlier is going to conflict with what you're about to play. Like a warning or a highlight or something. I figured it out but it was trial-and-error.

## Part 4: Variety & Session

**V1:** (b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles

**V2:** The Shampoo Thief — I got FLAWLESS and it felt like a payoff for learning from my mistakes. Also the $45 shampoo premise is hilarious and extremely relatable.

**V3:** The Thermostat War — not because it was bad, but because the AWAY/HOME cross-turn rejection felt punishing without enough warning. Once I understood it was a learning moment, but in the moment it felt unfair.

**V4:** Rank easiest to hardest:
1. The Shampoo Thief (easiest — clean tag groupings, no traps if you plan ahead)
2. The Last Slice (medium — familiar, but AWAKE speaker card adds scrutiny)
3. The Thermostat War (hardest — AWAY card is a trap that poisons later turns)

**V5:** Yes — the CONTESTED tag on some cards, the REFUTES mechanic, corroboration bonuses for matching tags, and cross-turn tag conflicts that can reject your play entirely. The thermostat puzzle had a deliberate trap where the strongest card (phone_gps AWAY) makes your other HOME cards unusable later.

**V6:** (a) Much better — variety kept me engaged

## Part 5: Product & Market

**M1:** (c) Both — daily puzzles plus a story mode

**M2:** (c) $1-2 one-time

**M3:** (b) Just right

**M4:** (b) 5-10 minutes

**M5:** (a) Phone app

**M6:** (b) Only if I got a good result

**M7:** "This game is low-key addictive detective vibes."

**M8:** The cross-turn tag conflict rejection in Thermostat War felt like it needed better signaling. When smart_lock + router got rejected, I didn't immediately understand it was because of the AWAY card from turn 1. A visual indicator showing "these tags will conflict with your previously played evidence" would prevent the confusion without removing the strategic depth. Also — the "leftover pad thai" line showed up on both puzzle 1 and puzzle 2 win screens, which broke the immersion slightly since puzzle 2 is about a thermostat, not food.
