# Post-Game Survey — Sarah (Playtest 3)

---

## Part 1: Open-Ended First

**O1:** Describe your experience in 2-3 sentences. What stood out?

Playing three different puzzles was way better than replaying the same one. The middle puzzle (Thermostat War) absolutely wrecked me because I got cocky and played a high-risk card when a safe one would've won it. But then I came back and got FLAWLESS on the Shampoo Thief which felt incredible — like I'd actually learned something real across the session.

**O2:** What was the single best moment across all 3 puzzles?

Getting FLAWLESS on Puzzle 3 in just 2 turns. I planned both corroboration pairs perfectly and it all clicked. The feeling of "I actually figured this out" was amazing.

**O3:** What was the single worst moment across all 3 puzzles?

Losing Puzzle 2 to scrutiny when I had already addressed all 3 concerns and only needed 1 more resistance. I played phone_gps (AWAY tag) after committing HOME cards and it gave me +4 scrutiny. I should have played motion_sensor for 2 damage. That was gut-wrenching.

**O4:** If you could change one thing about this game, what would it be?

Show me WHY a card gave extra scrutiny right when it happens. Like "AWAY conflicts with HOME — +2 extra scrutiny" so I don't have to guess what went wrong. The feedback after the fact is ok but in the moment I was like "wait why did I get +4??"

## Part 2: Puzzle-by-Puzzle Reactions

### Puzzle 1: The Last Slice
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: CLEAN
- Scrutiny: 4/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Won but barely — the AWAKE speaker card locked me out of ASLEEP cards on turn 3, forcing me to use the risky phone_gps which spiked scrutiny to 4.

### Puzzle 2: The Thermostat War
- Outcome: LOSS (scrutiny reached 5)
- Badge: N/A
- Scrutiny: 5/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Had all concerns addressed and only 1 resistance left but lost because I played a high-power AWAY card that contradicted my HOME evidence.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 1? Yes — I got caught by the AWAKE/ASLEEP trap and wanted to prove I could do better.

### Puzzle 3: The Shampoo Thief
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: FLAWLESS
- Scrutiny: 0/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Perfect run — paired HOME+HOME then ASLEEP+ASLEEP for double corroboration, won in 2 turns with zero scrutiny.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 2? Yes, absolutely — I lost and wanted redemption.

## Part 4: Variety & Session

**V1:** (b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles. Each puzzle had different tag traps (AWAKE/ASLEEP, AWAY/HOME) and different card compositions, but the core "pick cards, avoid contradictions, hit concerns" was the same.

**V2:** Puzzle 3 (Shampoo Thief) was my favorite. I applied everything I'd learned and got FLAWLESS. The scenario was funny too — $45 shampoo, come on.

**V3:** Puzzle 2 (Thermostat War) was my least favorite, but only because I lost in a painful way. The puzzle itself was fine — I just made a dumb mistake.

**V4:** Rank easiest to hardest:
1. The Shampoo Thief (easiest — clearest tag pairings)
2. The Thermostat War (medium — the AWAY trap is sneaky)
3. The Last Slice (hardest — INTENT forces you into AWAKE which locks out ASLEEP)

**V5:** I noticed corroboration (matching tags = bonus damage), tag conflicts (AWAKE vs ASLEEP, AWAY vs HOME cause extra scrutiny), and the repeated-concern penalty ("circling back"). The REFUTES mechanic on some cards was new but I didn't fully see what it did — my counters never seemed to fire.

**V6:** (a) Much better — variety kept me engaged. Replaying the same puzzle 3 times in playtest 2 was fine for learning, but this felt like an actual session. The emotional arc of "ok win, devastating loss, redemption win" was way more compelling.

## Part 5: Product & Market

**M1:** (c) Both — daily puzzles plus a story mode. Daily puzzle for the commute, story mode for when I'm hooked.

**M2:** (c) $1-2 one-time. I'd pay a buck or two for this easily. Not a subscription though.

**M3:** (b) Just right. Three puzzles was perfect — enough to feel progression without overstaying.

**M4:** (b) 5-10 minutes. Maybe closer to 10 with thinking time but it didn't feel long.

**M5:** (a) Phone app. This is a commute game for me.

**M6:** (b) Only if I got a good result. I'd absolutely share that FLAWLESS badge. The loss? No way.

**M7:** "This game is a smart little liar's puzzle."

**M8:** The one thing that felt slightly off: when phone_gps gave me +4 scrutiny in Puzzle 2, I didn't get a clear breakdown of why. The card said risk:2 but I got +4. I figured out it was the tag conflict + repeated concern, but the game should tell me that in the moment. Otherwise I might think it's broken or unfair when it's actually my fault.
