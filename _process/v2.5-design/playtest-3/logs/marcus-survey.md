# Post-Game Survey — Playtest 3 (Marcus)

Complete this AFTER all 3 puzzles. Be honest — critical feedback is more valuable than praise.

---

## Part 1: Open-Ended First (answer before reading the rest of the survey)

**O1:** Describe your experience in 2-3 sentences. What stood out?

Playing three different puzzles in one session was significantly more engaging than replaying the same one. Each puzzle had a meaningfully different card composition that forced me to rethink my approach — especially the trap cards (phone_gps in Thermostat War being AWAY when everything else was HOME). The progression from CLEAN to THOROUGH to FLAWLESS felt like genuine skill growth, not luck.

**O2:** What was the single best moment across all 3 puzzles?

Getting FLAWLESS on Puzzle 3. Zero scrutiny, 2 turns, perfectly paired tag corroborations. It felt earned — I used everything I learned from the first two puzzles to read the hand correctly and avoid every trap.

**O3:** What was the single worst moment across all 3 puzzles?

Puzzle 1, Turn 2 — seeing scrutiny jump to 4/5 despite winning. The "+4 scrutiny" felt opaque. I knew repetition risk existed from prior playtests, but I couldn't tell exactly how much came from tag behavior vs. duplicate concern proofs vs. base risk. The feedback said "you keep circling back" but I wasn't sure which mechanic triggered the spike.

**O4:** If you could change one thing about this game, what would it be?

Break down scrutiny gains per source. Instead of just "+4 (4/5)", show something like "+1 risk, +1 repeated concern, +2 tag conflict" so I can learn which part of my play was suboptimal. The game already tells me I made a mistake — it should help me understand which mistake.

## Part 2: Puzzle-by-Puzzle Reactions

### Puzzle 1: The Last Slice
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge (if won): CLEAN
- Scrutiny: 4/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: Paired HOME cards for corroboration on Turn 1, then paired two AWAKE cards (phone_gps + speaker) which dealt massive damage but spiked scrutiny to 4 from repeated concern proof and base risk.

### Puzzle 2: The Thermostat War
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge (if won): THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: Deliberately avoided the AWAY trap card (phone_gps), played all three HOME cards across turns with corroboration, used all 3 turns to grind through 14 resistance.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 1? Yes — I wanted to see if a new scenario would feel mechanically different, and it did.

### Puzzle 3: The Shampoo Thief
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge (if won): FLAWLESS
- Scrutiny: 0/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: Perfectly paired HOME+HOME then ASLEEP+ASLEEP for double corroboration, cleared 16 resistance in 2 turns with zero scrutiny.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 2? Yes — I got a new badge (THOROUGH) and wanted to see if I could do even better on a third puzzle.

## Part 3: Scaled Assessment

Rate 1-7. **1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree.**

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing after the session ended. **6** — I would have played a 4th puzzle. I stopped wanting more only because FLAWLESS felt like a natural high note to end on.
**S2:** I found myself thinking about strategies between puzzles. **7** — Absolutely. I was building a mental model of tag interactions, corroboration bonuses, and scrutiny sources across all three.
**S3:** The 3-puzzle session felt like the right amount. **6** — Very close to right. Could have gone to 4 or 5 before fatigue, but 3 was satisfying.

### Learning & Progression
**S4:** The second puzzle felt different from the first (not just a reskin). **6** — The AWAY vs HOME tag trap in Thermostat War created a genuinely different decision space. The concern set changing (ALERTNESS instead of INTENT) mattered too.
**S5:** Skills I learned in Puzzle 1 helped me in later puzzles. **7** — Tag matching, repetition avoidance, and concern coverage planning all transferred directly.
**S6:** I felt like I was getting better as I played more puzzles. **7** — CLEAN -> THOROUGH -> FLAWLESS is a clear upward trajectory.
**S7:** The difficulty progression felt natural. **5** — Puzzle 2 (resistance 14) was actually easier than Puzzle 1 (resistance 17). Puzzle 3 felt middle-ground. The difficulty didn't strictly escalate, which was fine for variety but felt slightly uneven.

### Clarity
**S8:** When I lost, I understood why. **N/A** — I didn't lose. But when scrutiny spiked in Puzzle 1, I partially understood why (repetition + risk) but not the exact breakdown.
**S9:** The feedback after each turn was useful. **5** — KOA's dialogue is flavorful but mechanically vague. "Noted. Continue." vs. "That checks out" gives emotional signal but not strategic signal. I want to know exactly what worked and what didn't.
**S10:** I was confused about what I was supposed to do. **2** (reverse-scored) — The rules were clear from the briefing. Only confusion was around secondary mechanics (CONTESTED, REFUTES, exact scrutiny calculation).

### Frustration
**S11:** I felt frustrated by things outside my control. **2** (reverse-scored) — Almost everything felt like my decision. The one frustration: not knowing exactly how scrutiny is calculated made some outcomes feel slightly opaque.
**S12:** When I made a mistake, it felt like MY mistake. **6** — The Puzzle 1 scrutiny spike was my choice to pair phone_gps + speaker. I just wish the feedback had confirmed which part was the mistake.
**S13:** The game was too hard. **2** (reverse-scored) — Won all three. Could have been slightly harder.
**S14:** The game was too easy. **3** (reverse-scored) — Puzzle 3 FLAWLESS in 2 turns felt almost too clean. But I attribute that to learning, not bad design.

### KOA
**S15:** KOA felt like a character, not just a system. **5** — The dialogue has personality ("And the leftover pad thai," "This troubles me more than your midnight snacking"). But KOA doesn't react differently to different strategies, which makes it feel more like flavor text than a character.
**S16:** KOA's responses influenced my decisions. **3** — Not really. I was playing the math, not reacting to KOA's tone. KOA's responses confirmed outcomes but didn't change my approach.

### Achievement
**S17:** I cared about getting a better badge. **7** — The CLEAN -> THOROUGH -> FLAWLESS progression was the main motivator across all three puzzles. I was actively optimizing for badge quality.
**S18:** Winning felt earned. **7** — Especially FLAWLESS. That required reading the hand, identifying tag pairs, planning concern coverage, and avoiding traps. Very satisfying.

### Net Promoter Score
**S19:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend? **7** — I would recommend it to my board game group specifically. The tag system has the "elegant systems" quality I appreciate. Not a 9-10 yet because the feedback loop needs polish and I want to see how the meta-game develops over weeks.

## Part 4: Variety & Session

**V1:** Did the 3 puzzles feel like 3 different experiences, or 3 versions of the same thing?
- **(b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles.** The core mechanic (pair matching tags, cover concerns, manage scrutiny) was the same, but each puzzle had a different trap structure. Thermostat War's AWAY/HOME tension was the most distinct. Shampoo Thief's three REFUTES cards felt like a different kind of puzzle.

**V2:** Which puzzle was your favorite and why?
The Shampoo Thief. It had the tightest math (18 total power vs. 16 resistance = almost no slack), the most REFUTES cards to think about, and achieving FLAWLESS on it felt like mastery. The scenario was also the funniest.

**V3:** Which puzzle was your least favorite and why?
The Last Slice (Puzzle 1). Not because it was bad, but because I've played it multiple times now and the novelty is gone. The card pool felt like it had one obvious trap (AWAKE cards) and one obvious safe path (HOME pair into AWAKE pair). Less decision tension than the other two.

**V4:** Rank the 3 puzzles from easiest to hardest:
1. The Thermostat War (lowest resistance, clear trap avoidance)
2. The Shampoo Thief (tight math but clean tag pairs available)
3. The Last Slice (highest resistance, forced to use risky AWAKE cards for INTENT)

**V5:** Did you notice different puzzle mechanics (traps, counters, corroboration)? What did you notice?
- Corroboration: Matching tags on paired cards gives bonus damage. Consistently worth +2 to +3 per pair.
- Traps: phone_gps in Thermostat War (AWAY tag that conflicts with all HOME cards — a high-power temptation that punishes you). AWAKE cards in Last Slice that conflict with ASLEEP narrative.
- REFUTES: Cards that preemptively cancel counters. Shampoo Thief had three of these. I played smart_lock (REFUTES counter_st1) in Puzzle 3 and the counter never fired, so presumably the refute worked. I still don't fully understand what happens if I DON'T play a refute card.
- CONTESTED: Some cards are marked CONTESTED but I never saw the contest trigger. Unclear mechanic.
- Repetition penalty: Proving an already-addressed concern adds extra scrutiny. Confirmed across multiple puzzles.

**V6:** How did the 3-puzzle session compare to replaying the same puzzle 3 times?
- **(a) Much better — variety kept me engaged.** Replaying Last Slice three times in Playtest 2 was about optimization and hypothesis testing. Playing three different puzzles was about adaptation and transfer learning. The latter felt more like a real game session.

## Part 5: Product & Market

**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
- **(c) Both — daily puzzles plus a story mode.** Daily puzzles for the quick bedtime session. Story mode for the weekend deep-dive. The KOA callbacks between puzzles ("midnight snacking") hint at a connected world that story mode could develop.

**M2:** Would you pay for this game?
- **(d) $3-5 one-time.** If the puzzle variety continues at this quality and there are 30+ puzzles, absolutely. The badge system gives replay value. I would not do a subscription — this is a "play when I want" game, not a daily obligation.

**M3:** How did this 3-puzzle session feel in terms of length?
- **(b) Just right.** Maybe slightly short — I could have done one more. But it fit my 15-20 minute window perfectly.

**M4:** How long did the full session (3 puzzles) feel like it took?
- **(b) 5-10 minutes.** Each puzzle was 2-3 minutes of analysis plus a few seconds of execution. The thinking was the gameplay.

**M5:** Where would you most want to play this?
- **(a) Phone app.** This is a bed-before-sleep game for me. Phone in hand, partner reading next to me, 10 minutes of mental engagement.

**M6:** Would you share your results?
- **(b) Only if I got a good result.** I would share the FLAWLESS badge. I would not share CLEAN.

**M7:** Complete this sentence: "This game is ___."
"This game is a logic puzzle that rewards reading between the lines."

**M8:** Is there anything about this game that felt broken, unfair, or confusing that we haven't asked about?

Three things:
1. **Scrutiny calculation is a black box.** The single biggest friction point. I can tell something went wrong but not what. Itemized scrutiny breakdown per turn would transform the learning experience.
2. **CONTESTED mechanic is invisible.** Several cards were marked [CONTESTED] but I never saw a contest happen. Either the mechanic didn't trigger or its effects were silent. Either way, I can't learn to play around something I can't observe.
3. **Badge names are still opaque.** I now know the ladder (WIN < CLEAN < THOROUGH < FLAWLESS) from experience, but the game never explains what earns each tier. A post-game breakdown ("FLAWLESS: 0 scrutiny, all concerns, under turn limit") would make the achievement system much clearer and give me concrete targets to aim for on replay.
