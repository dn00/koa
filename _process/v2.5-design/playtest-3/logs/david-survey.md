# Post-Game Survey — Playtest 3 (David)

---

## Part 1: Open-Ended First

**O1:** Three puzzles, three different lessons. The game rewards coherent storytelling over raw power — I learned that the hard way in Puzzle 2 when I grabbed the strongest card and got caught in a contradiction. By Puzzle 3 I was playing the story, not the numbers, and got a Flawless. The tag system is where the real depth lives.

**O2:** Getting FLAWLESS on Puzzle 3 with zero scrutiny. Not because I won, but because I could trace exactly how I earned it — I learned from the Thermostat War loss, picked a tag lane, and let corroboration carry me. That felt like genuine skill progression within a 15-minute session.

**O3:** Losing Puzzle 2 to scrutiny when I only needed 1 more damage. I played phone_gps (power 6, AWAY tag) when motion_sensor (power 2, ALONE tag) would have won it cleanly. The AWAY/HOME conflict spiked me from 2/5 to 5/5 scrutiny in one turn. Frustrating, but it was my fault.

**O4:** I'd like some kind of preview or warning about how much scrutiny a play will actually generate — not just the base risk number, but whether a tag conflict is about to fire. Even a subtle visual cue would help. The jump from risk:2 to +4 actual scrutiny felt opaque.

## Part 2: Puzzle-by-Puzzle Reactions

### Puzzle 1: The Last Slice
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: CLEAN
- Scrutiny: 4/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Leaned into AWAKE corroboration on turn 1 (phone_gps + speaker for 11 damage), then HOME corroboration on turn 2 to finish in 2 turns without needing any ASLEEP cards.

### Puzzle 2: The Thermostat War
- Outcome: LOSS (scrutiny reached 5)
- Badge: N/A
- Scrutiny: 5/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Won the argument but lost the case — addressed all concerns and broke resistance to 0, but phone_gps's AWAY tag conflicted with my HOME-heavy story and pushed scrutiny to exactly 5.
- **Between puzzles:** Yes — the tighter numbers in the harder Last Slice made me curious what a new scenario would feel like.

### Puzzle 3: The Shampoo Thief
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: FLAWLESS
- Scrutiny: 0/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Stayed in the ASLEEP lane turn 1, HOME lane turn 2, never introduced a conflicting tag, and let corroboration bonuses do the heavy lifting for a flawless win.
- **Between puzzles:** Yes — I lost Puzzle 2 due to a mistake I understood, and I wanted to prove I'd learned from it.

## Part 3: Scaled Assessment

### Engagement
**S1:** 6 — I was thinking about what I'd do differently in Puzzle 2 even as I started Puzzle 3.
**S2:** 7 — Absolutely. The loss in Puzzle 2 had me mentally replaying the optimal path before I even saw the Puzzle 3 cards.
**S3:** 5 — Three felt right for a session. I could see myself doing this daily.

### Learning & Progression
**S4:** 6 — Different cards, different tag tensions (AWAY/HOME vs AWAKE/ASLEEP), different optimal paths. Same core engine but new decisions.
**S5:** 7 — The corroboration lesson from Puzzle 1 directly enabled my Puzzle 3 FLAWLESS.
**S6:** 7 — Clear arc: CLEAN -> LOSS -> FLAWLESS. I was measurably better by Puzzle 3.
**S7:** 6 — Puzzle 2 was arguably harder than Puzzle 3 due to the math being tighter and the AWAY trap, but the loss made me sharper.

### Clarity
**S8:** 7 — Puzzle 2 loss was immediately understandable. AWAY conflicts with HOME. My fault.
**S9:** 5 — The corroboration bonus and concern tracking were clear. The scrutiny penalty from tag conflicts was less transparent — I didn't know AWAY+HOME would add +2 on top of base risk.
**S10:** 2 — Rules were clear from the start. I knew what I was doing by turn 1.

### Frustration
**S11:** 2 — Every outcome traced back to my choices.
**S12:** 7 — The Puzzle 2 loss was entirely my mistake. I could pinpoint the exact wrong card.
**S13:** 2 — Challenging but fair. The math is tight by design.
**S14:** 2 — Never felt easy. Even the FLAWLESS win required careful planning.

### KOA
**S15:** 5 — KOA has personality — the "annoyingly consistent" line and the "this troubles me" line felt like a character. But it's still mostly a scoring system with flavor text.
**S16:** 4 — KOA's feedback confirmed my reads but didn't change my plans mid-game. The concern tracking influenced me more than KOA's dialogue.

### Achievement
**S17:** 7 — Going from CLEAN to LOSS to FLAWLESS was a genuine arc. I cared about the badge upgrade.
**S18:** 7 — FLAWLESS felt earned. I could trace the skill progression across all three puzzles.

### Net Promoter Score
**S19:** 8 — I'd recommend this to people who like puzzle games and appreciate tight design. It's not for everyone, but for the right audience it's very satisfying.

## Part 4: Variety & Session

**V1:** (b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles. The AWAY/HOME tension in Thermostat War and the ASLEEP/AWAKE tension in Shampoo Thief are structurally similar but play differently. The card compositions forced different strategies.

**V2:** The Shampoo Thief — because it rewarded everything I'd learned. The card pool was tight enough that you couldn't brute-force it, but the ASLEEP+HOME path was clean if you recognized the pattern. Getting FLAWLESS felt like graduation.

**V3:** The Thermostat War — not because it was bad, but because the scrutiny spike from phone_gps felt punishing in a way I couldn't predict. The +4 scrutiny from a single card (2 base risk + 2 conflict penalty?) was the one moment that felt opaque.

**V4:** Rank easiest to hardest:
1. The Last Slice (enough power headroom to find a clean path)
2. The Shampoo Thief (tight numbers but clear tag lanes)
3. The Thermostat War (the AWAY card trap makes the optimal path non-obvious)

**V5:** Yes. Corroboration was the main mechanic I exploited — pairing same-tag cards for bonus damage. The CONTESTED tag on some cards seemed like a trap mechanic (router in Puzzle 2, wifi_log in Puzzle 3). REFUTES cards seemed to prevent counters but I'm not sure they fired since I won before they were needed. The tag conflict system (AWAKE vs ASLEEP, AWAY vs HOME) is the core tension and the most interesting mechanic.

**V6:** (a) Much better — variety kept me engaged. In playtest 2, replaying the same puzzle felt like optimization. Here, each puzzle required re-evaluating from scratch, and the loss in Puzzle 2 created a genuine learning arc that wouldn't have happened with repetition.

## Part 5: Product & Market

**M1:** (c) Both — daily puzzles plus a story mode. The daily puzzle format is perfect for my schedule (waiting rooms, commutes). But a story mode with escalating difficulty would give me a reason to invest more deeply.

**M2:** (c) $1-2 one-time. This is well-designed enough that I'd pay for it, but I'm not subscribing to a puzzle game. One-time purchase respects my time.

**M3:** (b) Just right. Three puzzles with the learning arc felt complete. I could have done a fourth but I wasn't restless.

**M4:** (b) 5-10 minutes. Quick enough for a waiting room, substantial enough to feel like I did something.

**M5:** (a) Phone app. This is a waiting-room game for me. Needs to be on my phone, quick to launch.

**M6:** (b) Only if I got a good result. I'd share the FLAWLESS badge. I wouldn't share the Thermostat War loss.

**M7:** "This game is a logic puzzle disguised as a conversation."

**M8:** The scrutiny penalty from tag conflicts should be more transparent. I understand the design intent — contradictions should be punishing — but the gap between displayed risk and actual scrutiny cost made my Puzzle 2 loss feel partially opaque. Even a "warning: this conflicts with previous evidence" before confirming the play would help. Everything else felt fair and well-crafted.
