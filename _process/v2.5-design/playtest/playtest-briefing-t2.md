# The Last Slice — How to Play

You are playing a puzzle game called "The Last Slice." You are a suspect in a mystery and must convince an investigator (KOA) that you are innocent.

## Rules

**Your goal:** Deal enough damage to KOA's case to clear yourself before running out of turns or getting caught in too many lies.

**Cards:** You have a hand of evidence cards. Each card has:
- **Power** — how much damage it deals to KOA's case
- **Risk** — how much scrutiny it adds (scrutiny is bad)
- **Tag** — a descriptor like HOME, ASLEEP, AWAKE, etc.

**Each turn:** You select 1-2 cards to submit as evidence. Cards are removed from your hand after submission.

**You win** if total damage ≥ the resistance threshold before you run out of turns.
**You lose** if you run out of turns without enough damage, OR if scrutiny reaches the limit.

**Scrutiny** is tracked across the game. Each card's risk adds to scrutiny. If scrutiny hits the limit, you lose immediately.

**KOA** will respond to your submissions. Pay attention to what KOA says.

## One More Thing

Be careful about which cards you combine. Some cards may **conflict** with each other based on their tags. If your story doesn't add up, KOA will notice.

## How to Play (CLI)

When prompted, type the card IDs you want to submit, separated by commas.
Example: `doorbell, fitbit`

Type card IDs exactly as shown in your hand display.

## Your Task

Play the game to the best of your ability. Try to win. Pay attention to feedback after each turn — it may help you make better decisions.

Good luck.
