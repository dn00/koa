## Q1: Strategy Discovery

I discovered that pairing cards with the same tag gives a corroboration bonus — extra damage on top of the base power. In Run 1 I paired fitbit+thermostat (different tags) and got 7 damage (just base). In Run 2 I paired doorbell+thermostat (both HOME) and got 8 damage (6 base + 2 corroboration). Then fitbit+security_cam (both ASLEEP, different device sources) gave a whopping 12 damage (9 base + 3 corroboration). The different-source bonus seemed larger (30% vs 20%, though I only inferred this from the numbers).

I also discovered that the doorbell's "REFUTES: counter_alibi" mechanic removes the CONTESTED penalty from security_cam. In Run 1 I played them together and KOA said "that checks out" and dropped the counter-evidence. In Run 2 I played doorbell first, and by Turn 2 the security_cam was no longer marked CONTESTED.

I never figured out what happens with contradictions (opposing tags like ASLEEP vs AWAKE) because I was too cautious to test it.

## Q2: Adaptation

Run 1 to Run 2 was the big shift. In Run 1 I played safe zero-risk cards first (fitbit+thermostat), which worked but didn't leverage corroboration. After seeing the corroboration bonus mechanic in the results, I restructured Run 2 to maximize tag-matching: doorbell+thermostat (HOME+HOME) in Turn 1, fitbit+security_cam (ASLEEP+ASLEEP) in Turn 2. This was dramatically more efficient — 20 total damage vs 15 in Run 1.

Run 2 to Run 3: I didn't change anything. I found a safe, reliable winning strategy and stuck with it. I was tempted to try for FLAWLESS (which seems to require all 3 concerns addressed) by working in the speaker card for INTENT, but the speaker has an AWAKE tag which would contradict my ASLEEP cards. That's exactly the kind of risk I refuse to take when I already have a winning formula.

## Q3: KOA

KOA felt more like a character than a pure game system. The dialogue was flavorful — "Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent" made me smile and confirmed I was doing something right with corroboration. "Fine. That checks out. I'll drop that line of questioning" told me the refutation mechanic worked.

However, KOA's responses didn't change my decisions much because I was already winning. If I had lost or seen a warning, I think KOA's feedback would have been more impactful. The "Noted. Continue." response in Run 1 Turn 1 was the least informative — it told me nothing went wrong but also nothing went especially right.

## Q4: Enjoyment

3.5 out of 5. The puzzle has satisfying "aha" moments (discovering corroboration, figuring out the refutation chain). But as a cautious player, I found a winning formula quickly and then had no incentive to deviate. The game rewarded my personality type with consistent wins but didn't push me to explore the riskier parts of the design space. I never touched phone_gps, speaker, or microwave in my winning runs.

## Q5: Replay

Yes, I would play another puzzle. The corroboration and tag-matching mechanics are interesting to optimize around. I'd want a puzzle where the "safe" path isn't quite enough to win, forcing me out of my comfort zone. This puzzle was solvable without ever engaging with the AWAKE cards, the contradiction system, or the INTENT concern — which means I missed a chunk of the design.

## Q6: Confusion

The CONTESTED mechanic was slightly confusing at first. I could see security_cam was marked [CONTESTED] and doorbell said REFUTES:counter_alibi, so I guessed I should play doorbell to help security_cam, but I wasn't sure whether I needed to play them in the same turn or if order mattered. It turned out either way works.

I was also unsure what "concerns addressed" meant for the final outcome. I got 2/3 every time but still got CLEAN badge. The rules say "win if total damage >= resistance" but don't explain concerns or badges at all. Are concerns just for a higher badge tier? That wasn't clear.

## Q7: Memorable Moment

Turn 2 of Run 2 — seeing "12 damage (9 base + 3 corroboration)" with the message "Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent." It felt like cracking the puzzle wide open. I had figured out both the tag-matching bonus AND the source-diversity bonus AND the refutation chain, all clicking together in one turn. That moment of systemic understanding was the highlight.

## Q8: Difficulty

(a) Too easy — for a cautious player. I won all 3 runs, always in 2 turns, always with CLEAN badge. I never felt at risk of losing. The scrutiny limit of 5 was generous given that my winning path only accumulated 1 scrutiny. However, I suspect the difficulty is "about right" for players who are tempted by phone_gps (risk 2, AWAKE tag) — those players might stumble into contradictions and scrutiny problems. The puzzle seems designed to punish aggressive play more than reward cautious play.

## Q9: What You'd Tell a Friend

"It's a card puzzle where you're building an alibi — you match evidence from smart home devices, but using the wrong combination can contradict your story and make things worse."
