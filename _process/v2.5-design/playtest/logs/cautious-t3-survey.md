# Post-Game Survey — Cautious Persona (Tier 3: Full Knowledge)

## Run Summary

### Run 1
- **Moves:** T1: doorbell | T2: fitbit,security_cam | T3: (not needed)
- **Outcome:** WIN in 2 turns
- **Final Scrutiny:** 1/5
- **Badge:** CLEAN
- **Concerns Addressed:** 1/3 (IDENTITY)
- **Notes:** Led with doorbell to refute counter_alibi before playing security_cam. Corroboration bonus on fitbit+security_cam (ASLEEP, diverse sources) dealt 12 damage. Game ended before Turn 3.

### Run 2
- **Moves:** T1: fitbit,security_cam | T2: doorbell | T3: thermostat
- **Outcome:** WIN in 3 turns
- **Final Scrutiny:** 1/5
- **Badge:** CLEAN
- **Concerns Addressed:** 2/3 (IDENTITY, LOCATION)
- **Notes:** Opened with the corroboration pair without refuting first. Security_cam was contested (half power = 3 instead of 5), but the 30% corroboration bonus still produced 10 damage. Needed all 3 turns but won comfortably at scrutiny 1.

### Run 3
- **Moves:** T1: fitbit | T2: doorbell,thermostat | T3: security_cam
- **Outcome:** WIN in 3 turns
- **Final Scrutiny:** 1/5
- **Badge:** CLEAN
- **Concerns Addressed:** 2/3 (IDENTITY, LOCATION)
- **Notes:** Spread damage evenly. Used doorbell+thermostat HOME corroboration (same tag, different sources = 30% bonus, 8 damage). Doorbell refuted counter_alibi so security_cam hit for full 5 on T3. Scrutiny stayed at 0 until final turn.

## Q1: Strategy Discovery

I knew all the mechanics going in, so there was nothing to "discover" per se. But I confirmed several things through play:

- **Refutation order matters.** In Run 1, playing doorbell first to refute counter_alibi before submitting security_cam meant I got full power (5) instead of contested half (3). In Run 2 I reversed the order and security_cam was penalized. The difference was 2 damage — not fatal, but it cost me an extra turn.
- **Corroboration with source diversity is the key damage multiplier.** The 30% bonus from two ASLEEP cards (fitbit + security_cam from different device types) turned 9 base into 12. That was the single biggest swing in every run.
- **The AWAKE cards (phone_gps, speaker) are traps for a cautious player.** phone_gps has risk 2, contradicts the ASLEEP cards I need, and duplicates thermostat's LOCATION proof type (repetition risk). speaker contradicts ASLEEP and only proves INTENT. I never touched either of them.

## Q2: Adaptation

My approach did not change dramatically because I was cautious from the start and won all three runs. The main adjustment was sequencing:

- **Run 1** taught me that refuting first is efficient — it let me win in 2 turns.
- **Run 2** I deliberately tested the "what if I don't refute first?" path. The contested penalty on security_cam made the game tighter but still winnable. This confirmed my preference for the Run 1 ordering.
- **Run 3** I tried a more spread-out approach with single cards on turns 1 and 3, and a HOME corroboration pair on turn 2. It worked fine but felt slower. No real pressure.

Honestly, once I identified the safe card pool (fitbit, doorbell, thermostat, security_cam, microwave), the game felt solved. I never needed to adapt under pressure because I never took risks.

## Q3: KOA

KOA's responses were informative but did not change my decisions, because I already knew the mechanics. The refutation dialogue ("I'll drop that line of questioning") confirmed that counter_alibi was neutralized. The corroboration dialogue ("Two different devices agreeing?") confirmed the bonus fired.

KOA felt more like a **game system with flavor text** than a character. The lines are well-written and thematic, but since I was reading the mechanics, not the dialogue, to make decisions, KOA did not feel like an adversary I was outwitting. KOA felt like a score readout wearing a trench coat.

The one moment that came closest to "character" was the contested card warning: "About that Security camera... I have counter-evidence. Half credit." That felt like KOA was actually pushing back.

## Q4: Enjoyment

**2 out of 5.** The puzzle is well-constructed, but as a cautious player with full mechanical knowledge, there was no tension. I identified the safe path immediately, avoided all traps, and won every run. The game felt like an optimization exercise rather than a puzzle. I suspect it would be more engaging if I did not know the mechanics up front, or if I were a bolder player willing to touch the AWAKE cards.

## Q5: Replay

**Conditionally yes.** The mechanics are sound and I can see them creating interesting dilemmas in a puzzle where the safe path is not so obvious. If a different puzzle forced me to use at least one risky card — maybe by setting a higher resistance threshold or giving fewer safe options — I would feel more engaged. The current puzzle has too much "safe surplus" for a cautious player.

## Q6: Confusion

Nothing was confusing mechanically. Two minor frustrations:

- **No way to see the math.** When corroboration fired, I saw "7 base + 3 corroboration" but could not see that security_cam was contested (power 3 instead of 5) unless I already knew. The contested warning came AFTER the damage line. For a cautious player who wants to verify everything, showing the per-card breakdown would help.
- **Concerns felt vestigial.** I addressed 1-2 out of 3 concerns across my runs but still won every time. I never felt pressure to address them. If concerns had a mechanical impact (e.g., unaddressed concerns add scrutiny at game end), they would matter more.

## Q7: Memorable Moment

Run 1, Turn 2: playing fitbit + security_cam after refuting counter_alibi, seeing 12 damage obliterate the remaining 11 resistance in a single turn. The corroboration bonus turning a careful two-card play into an overwhelming blow felt satisfying — like being rewarded for preparation.

## Q8: Difficulty

**(a) Too easy.** With full knowledge of the mechanics, I never felt at risk. The safe card pool (fitbit, doorbell, thermostat, security_cam) has enough total power (15 base, plus corroboration bonuses) to clear 14 resistance with scrutiny to spare. The AWAKE cards are clearly marked as traps and easily avoided. A cautious player with tier-3 knowledge has a trivial path to victory.

## Q9: What You'd Tell a Friend

"It's a card puzzle where you prove your alibi to a smart home AI — the tricky part is that some evidence helps your case but contradicts other evidence you already submitted, so you have to plan your story carefully."
