## Q1: Strategy Discovery

I figured out a few things the rules did not explain:

- **Corroboration bonuses**: Playing two cards with the same tag in one turn gives a damage bonus. If those cards come from different devices (sources), the bonus is bigger (I saw 30% vs 20%). This was never stated but became clear from the math in run 2.
- **Repetition penalty**: Playing a card that proves the same proof type as something I already submitted adds extra scrutiny. I noticed this in run 1 when microwave (ALERTNESS) triggered a repetition warning because fitbit already proved ALERTNESS.
- **Counter-evidence and refutation**: The security camera was CONTESTED until I played the doorbell, which refuted the counter. Ordering matters -- refute first, then play the strong card.
- **Tag conflicts**: AWAKE and ASLEEP are opposing tags. I was told cards can conflict by tags, so I stayed away from AWAKE cards entirely. It felt safer to never touch them.

## Q2: Adaptation

Run 1 was pure caution -- all zero-risk cards, one card at a time when possible. I lost with 2 resistance remaining. The math just was not there.

For run 2, I realized I needed the security camera's power (5), but it was contested. So I played doorbell first to refute the counter, then paired fitbit + security_cam for the corroboration bonus. That was the key insight: a little risk (risk 1 on doorbell and security_cam) was necessary to generate enough damage.

For run 3, I tried to address more concerns by pairing doorbell + thermostat on turn 1 (both HOME, which gave a corroboration bonus I did not expect). Then the same fitbit + security_cam combo on turn 2 sealed it. I wanted to address the INTENT concern too, but the only card for that was the speaker (AWAKE tag), and I was not willing to risk a contradiction after committing ASLEEP with the fitbit.

## Q3: KOA

KOA's responses influenced me somewhat. The "you keep circling back to that same point" line in run 1 made me realize I was proving the same thing twice (ALERTNESS via both fitbit and microwave). That was a real "oh, I should diversify my proofs" moment.

The "Fine. That checks out. I'll drop that line of questioning" when I played doorbell was satisfying -- it confirmed the refutation worked and made me feel like the counter-evidence system was worth engaging with.

KOA felt more like a character than a raw game system, but only barely. The voice lines were fun, but I could see the system behind them. "Two different devices agreeing? That's annoyingly consistent" was my favorite -- it rewarded smart play with personality.

## Q4: Enjoyment

4 out of 5. I genuinely enjoyed the puzzle-solving. The first loss taught me something, and the subsequent wins felt earned. The only reason it is not a 5 is that 3 runs on the same puzzle started feeling solved by run 3.

## Q5: Replay

Yes, I would play a different puzzle. The core mechanics -- corroboration, contradictions, refutation ordering -- are interesting enough to carry new scenarios. I would especially like to see a puzzle where the "safe" path is not so clearly separated from the "risky" path. Here, the AWAKE cards were obviously traps for a cautious player. A scenario where you have to take a calculated risk would be more interesting.

## Q6: Confusion

- The **repetition risk** mechanic was not obvious. In run 1, I did not understand why playing microwave after fitbit added scrutiny until I reasoned about it afterward. The briefing said nothing about proof types repeating. KOA's line about "circling back" helped, but I had to infer the mechanic.
- The **corroboration bonus** was completely hidden. I only noticed it because the damage numbers did not add up to what I expected. A hint that "consistent evidence is stronger" would have been welcome without spoiling the mechanic.
- I was never sure if **concerns** mattered for winning. I addressed 2/3 in my wins and still got CLEAN badge. Are concerns just for a higher badge? That was unclear.

## Q7: Memorable Moment

The moment in run 2 when fitbit + security_cam dealt 12 damage (9 base + 3 corroboration) and KOA said "Two different devices agreeing? That's annoyingly consistent." It felt like cracking the puzzle open. I had set it up by refuting the counter on turn 1, and the payoff was immediate and decisive. That was the "aha" moment of the whole session.

## Q8: Difficulty

(b) About right. Run 1 taught me the lesson. Run 2 let me apply it. Run 3 let me optimize. The difficulty curve across runs was well-paced. I never felt it was unfair -- the loss in run 1 was clearly because I played too conservatively, not because the game cheated.

## Q9: What You'd Tell a Friend

"It's a logic puzzle where you pick evidence cards to prove your innocence, but you have to figure out which cards work together and which ones contradict each other before KOA catches you in a lie."
