# Post-Game Survey — Impulsive Persona (T3: Full Knowledge)

## Run Summary

| Run | Turn 1 | Turn 2 | Turn 3 | Outcome | Final Scrutiny |
|-----|--------|--------|--------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | phone_gps, security_cam | fitbit, doorbell (BLOCKED) -> thermostat, doorbell | n/a | LOSS (scrutiny 5/5) | 5/5 |
| 2 | fitbit, security_cam | phone_gps, doorbell | n/a | WIN (2 turns) | 4/5 |
| 3 | phone_gps, thermostat | security_cam, doorbell | n/a | WIN (2 turns) | 4/5 |

## Q1: Strategy Discovery
Honestly? I figured out pretty fast that phone_gps is a trap. It's got the highest power but the AWAKE tag poisons everything — once it's in play, any ASLEEP card triggers a contradiction. In Run 1 I paired it WITH the other big card (security_cam, also power 5) and that was a disaster: AWAKE vs ASLEEP contradiction on turn 1, plus security_cam is contested so it only did half damage anyway. Ended up locked out of playing most of my hand.

The real discovery: fitbit + security_cam is the power combo. Same tag (ASLEEP), different device sources, so you get the 30% corroboration bonus. That's 10 damage in one turn. Boom.

## Q2: Adaptation
Run 1: "Biggest numbers go first, obviously." Picked phone_gps (5) + security_cam (5). Got absolutely wrecked — contradiction warning, contested penalty, scrutiny at 4 after one turn, then everything I tried to play got blocked. Lost even though I technically broke resistance on the last play. Scrutiny got me.

Run 2: "OK, maybe don't play the two cards that literally contradict each other." Swapped phone_gps out of turn 1, led with fitbit + security_cam instead. Huge difference — corroboration bonus, low scrutiny. Then I STILL played phone_gps on turn 2 because I couldn't resist that power:5. Won, but barely (scrutiny 4/5).

Run 3: "What if I pair phone_gps with something safe instead?" Played phone_gps + thermostat (both prove LOCATION so there's repetition risk but... wait, they're on the same turn so maybe not? Actually thermostat is HOME not AWAKE so no contradiction). Won again, same razor-thin margin.

The adaptation was basically: stop pairing contradicting tags together. But I never fully gave up on phone_gps because the number 5 is just too juicy.

## Q3: KOA
KOA's "doesn't quite line up" line made me go "oh crap" in Run 1. That was the contradiction warning. But honestly I was already committed by then — the damage was done. KOA felt more like a judge reading verdicts than a character I was having a conversation with. The "annoyingly consistent" line when I got the corroboration bonus in Run 2 was fun though — felt like I actually got under KOA's skin.

The "half credit" line about the security camera was useful — it told me the contested mechanic was real and costing me. But I didn't really change my behavior because of KOA's words. I changed because of the numbers.

## Q4: Enjoyment
3.5 — bumping to 4. The first run was genuinely surprising when everything got blocked and I was stuck. That "oh no" moment was actually fun. But by run 3 I felt like I'd mostly solved it and was just optimizing, which is less exciting.

## Q5: Replay
Yeah, I would. The card interactions are more interesting than they look at first. I went in thinking "just play the big numbers" and got punished for it. A different puzzle with different traps would be cool — I want to see if I've actually learned the mechanics or if I just memorized this specific puzzle.

## Q6: Confusion
The contradiction blocking was confusing at first. In Run 1, I played phone_gps (AWAKE) + security_cam (ASLEEP) together and got a warning. Fine. But then EVERY card I tried after that got blocked — fitbit (ASLEEP) blocked because AWAKE was already committed, speaker (AWAKE) blocked because ASLEEP was already committed. I had poisoned both sides of the axis in one move and didn't realize that would lock me out of half my hand.

Also: the security_cam being "contested" and doing half damage isn't super clear until it happens. I knew the doorbell refutes the counter, but I kept not prioritizing it because power:3 looks boring next to power:5.

## Q7: Memorable Moment
Run 1, Turn 2 — watching fitbit+doorbell get BLOCKED, then trying thermostat+doorbell and THAT working but pushing me to exactly 5 scrutiny. I broke the resistance AND hit the scrutiny limit on the same play. Lost by a hair. That simultaneous "I did it! / wait no I didn't" was genuinely dramatic.

## Q8: Difficulty
(b) about right, leaning toward (c) too hard for an impulsive player. If you go in swinging you will lose. The game punishes the obvious "big number" strategy, which is clever but means you basically have to lose once before you can win. That feels right for a puzzle game.

## Q9: What You'd Tell a Friend
"It's like a card game where you're lying to a smart fridge, and the biggest cards are traps — you gotta figure out which evidence actually fits together or you'll contradict yourself and get locked out."
