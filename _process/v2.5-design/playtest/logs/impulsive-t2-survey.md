## Q1: Strategy Discovery
I figured out that tags matter A LOT. In Run 1 I played phone_gps (AWAKE) and security_cam (ASLEEP) together and KOA warned me things didn't line up. Then every card after that got rejected because I'd already used my one "free pass" on contradictions. So the rule I discovered: don't mix ASLEEP and AWAKE cards. Stick to one story.

I also figured out that playing two cards with the same tag gives you a bonus — fitbit + security_cam are both ASLEEP and I got a "corroboration" bonus that bumped my damage from 7 to 10. That was huge. And doorbell + thermostat are both HOME and got a bonus too.

The "CONTESTED" tag on security_cam was interesting — doorbell says it "REFUTES" the counter, so if you play doorbell first, the security cam gets full power later. I noticed that in Run 3.

## Q2: Adaptation
Run 1 was a disaster. I grabbed the two biggest numbers (phone_gps 5 + security_cam 5) and got wrecked by contradictions and scrutiny. Everything after that was blocked because I'd burned my one warning.

Run 2 I dropped phone_gps entirely and paired fitbit with security_cam instead — same ASLEEP tag, big corroboration bonus, won in 2 turns. Run 3 I played doorbell first to refute the counter-evidence, which let security_cam hit at full power on turn 2. Both wins felt easy once I stopped contradicting myself.

The specific feedback that changed things: "That doesn't quite line up" warning in Run 1, plus getting blocked twice in a row. That was a loud enough signal even for me.

## Q3: KOA
KOA's "that doesn't quite line up" line in Run 1 was the wake-up call. The "Two different devices agreeing? That's annoyingly consistent" in Run 2 felt rewarding — like I outsmarted the investigator. KOA felt more like a character than a system, especially with the pizza-themed dialogue. The fridge-locking threat at the end of a loss was funny.

That said, I mostly skimmed KOA's lines. The contradiction warning was the only one that actually changed my behavior.

## Q4: Enjoyment
4 out of 5. Run 1 was frustrating (getting blocked repeatedly with no way to recover felt bad), but once I figured out the tag system in Run 2, it clicked and felt satisfying. The 2-turn win was a rush.

## Q5: Replay
Yeah, I'd play another puzzle. The tag-matching system is simple enough to pick up fast but there's enough variety in card combos to make it interesting. I'd want a puzzle with more cards and more turns though — 3 turns felt tight (which is good for tension but I wanted more chances to try stuff).

## Q6: Confusion
The biggest confusion in Run 1 was getting blocked and not understanding exactly WHY. I knew "cards can conflict based on tags" but I didn't realize it was specifically about opposite pairs (ASLEEP vs AWAKE). The game told me it contradicted but didn't explain what the conflict was. For a casual player that's fine — I figured it out by Run 2 — but the first loss felt a bit opaque.

Also: "CONTESTED" wasn't explained anywhere. I had to figure out that meant half damage. The REFUTES mechanic on doorbell was also not explained — I just noticed the label and tried playing it first in Run 3.

## Q7: Memorable Moment
Getting blocked TWICE in a row in Run 1. I was sitting there with 4 scrutiny, 6 resistance left, and literally every card combination I tried got rejected. That "oh no" moment when I realized I'd locked myself out of my own hand was genuinely dramatic. The game was basically over after Turn 1 and I didn't even know it yet.

## Q8: Difficulty
(b) About right — once I stopped fighting the tag system. Run 1 felt (d) unfair because I didn't understand the contradiction mechanic, but by Run 2 it felt totally fair. The puzzle rewards you for paying attention to tags, which is a good difficulty curve for a casual player.

## Q9: What You'd Tell a Friend
"You pick evidence cards to prove your alibi, but if your story contradicts itself the investigator shuts you down — so don't say you were asleep AND awake at the same time."
