## Q1: Strategy Discovery

Honestly I just grabbed the biggest numbers I could find. Run 1 I went phone_gps (power 5!) and security_cam (power 5!) because duh, 10 power right? Turns out that was only 8 because of some "contested" thing AND it blew up my scrutiny to 4 out of 5 in ONE turn. Also KOA said something about contradictions. I didn't really get why until run 2 when I tried the fitbit+security_cam combo instead and got a fat corroboration bonus. So I guess I figured out: same-tag cards together = bonus damage. And mixing ASLEEP with AWAKE = bad news.

## Q2: Adaptation

Run 1 I just slammed the two biggest power cards. Total disaster. Scrutiny through the roof, got blocked, then lost anyway. Run 2 I was like "ok maybe pair the two ASLEEP cards together" and it worked way better — got 10 damage in one turn from corroboration. Run 3 I did the same opening and then went with the safe HOME cards (doorbell + thermostat) instead of the risky phone_gps. The phone_gps card is a trap honestly. Power 5 but risk 2 AND it says AWAKE which contradicts everything else.

## Q3: KOA

KOA kinda felt like a character, yeah. When KOA said "That doesn't quite line up" in Run 1, I was like "whatever, I'll figure it out." Then when my next move got straight-up REJECTED I was like "oh, that warning actually meant something." The "Two different devices agreeing? That's annoyingly consistent" line was satisfying in Runs 2-3. Made me feel like I was actually outsmarting someone. But honestly I mostly just looked at the numbers, not the dialogue.

## Q4: Enjoyment

3.5 — I'll say 4. It's quick which I like. The first run was frustrating but figuring out the corroboration thing felt good. I don't love losing to scrutiny when I also broke the resistance to zero in the same turn (Run 1). That felt unfair.

## Q5: Replay

Yeah sure, I'd play another puzzle. The card combos are kinda fun once you get the matching thing down. Would be cool if there were more cards to mess around with. Three turns goes fast though — I like fast.

## Q6: Confusion

The biggest confusion was Run 1 Turn 1. I played phone_gps + security_cam and got hit with a contradiction warning, contested half-credit, AND huge scrutiny all at once. I didn't know what caused what. The scrutiny just said "+4" but I had no idea that was from risk (3) + contradiction (1). Also the "CONTESTED" label on security_cam — I saw it but didn't know what it meant until KOA said "half credit." Would've been nice to know up front that contested means your power gets cut in half unless you do something about it.

Also: getting blocked on a contradiction is harsh when you don't know which tags contradict. I played fitbit (ASLEEP) after already playing an ASLEEP card and an AWAKE card, and it got rejected. I thought ASLEEP would be fine since I already had an ASLEEP card committed. Took me a sec to realize it was the AWAKE card (phone_gps) that was the problem.

## Q7: Memorable Moment

Run 1, getting my move REJECTED. "That directly contradicts what you already showed me." I was genuinely surprised. I'd been cruising thinking I was doing great, and then bam — full stop. That's when the game clicked as something more than just "play big cards."

## Q8: Difficulty

Somewhere between (b) about right and (c) too hard. Run 1 felt punishing — one bad opening and you're basically dead. But Runs 2-3 felt about right once I knew not to touch phone_gps first. I'd say (b) about right overall, but the learning curve is steep for Turn 1.

## Q9: What You'd Tell a Friend

"It's like a bluffing card game where you're trying to prove you didn't eat the pizza — match your evidence tags for bonus damage but don't contradict yourself or KOA catches you."
