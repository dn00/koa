## Part 1: Open-Ended First (answer before reading the rest of the survey)

**O1:** Describe your experience in 2-3 sentences. What stood out?

The game rewards careful reading and systematic thinking, which I enjoyed. The card interactions (corroboration, contradiction, refutation) create a real puzzle underneath the narrative flavor. What stood out most was discovering that the highest-power card is almost always a trap — the game is about efficiency and consistency, not raw damage.

**O2:** What was the single best moment across all 3 puzzles?

Getting FLAWLESS on Puzzle 2 (The Thermostat War). I correctly identified the corroboration opportunity, avoided the trap card (phone_gps with AWAY tag), and threaded the needle on scrutiny. It felt earned because I applied what I learned from Puzzle 1.

**O3:** What was the single worst moment across all 3 puzzles?

Getting blocked on my first attempt at Puzzle 3, Turn 3, when I tried to play doorbell_cam + tv_log (both IDLE) after committing smartwatch (ACTIVE). I understood single-card contradictions but didn't realize that two cards sharing the same conflicting tag would cause the second one to trigger a block. It felt unfair because the game doesn't explain that two cards in a single turn are evaluated sequentially against the contradiction rule.

**O4:** If you could change one thing about this game, what would it be?

Show the tag conflict pairs somewhere in the UI. I had to infer that HOME/AWAY, ASLEEP/AWAKE, IDLE/ACTIVE, and ALONE/ACCOMPANIED were opposing pairs. A small legend or tooltip would make the first puzzle less about guessing tag relationships and more about strategic card selection.

## Part 2: Puzzle-by-Puzzle Reactions

### Puzzle 1
- Outcome: WIN (reason: all conditions met)
- Badge (if won): THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: I correctly refuted the counter on Turn 1 and kept scrutiny low, but the forced AWAKE/ASLEEP conflict on Turn 3 (speaker is the only INTENT card) cost me FLAWLESS.

### Puzzle 2
- Outcome: WIN (reason: all conditions met)
- Badge (if won): FLAWLESS
- Scrutiny: 2/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: Applied Puzzle 1 lessons — corroboration on Turn 1, avoided the trap card, and used a no-proves filler card for clean damage on Turn 3.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 1? (Yes / No / Unsure) Yes — I wanted to test my hypotheses about the mechanics.

### Puzzle 3
- Outcome: WIN (reason: all conditions met)
- Badge (if won): THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: Strong corroboration on Turn 1 but got caught by the ACTIVE/IDLE conflict, forcing a repetition penalty I could have avoided by playing tv_log solo instead of motion_sensor.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 2? (Yes / No / Unsure) Yes — I wanted to see if Puzzle 3 introduced new mechanics.

## Part 3: KOA (the investigator)

**K1:** Did KOA make you laugh or smile at any point? If yes, what did KOA say? (quote it if you remember)

Yes. "You got through. But I'm watching you. And the leftover pad thai." — the domestic pettiness of the scenarios combined with KOA's deadpan investigator tone is genuinely funny.

**K2:** Did KOA ever annoy you? If yes, what triggered it?

Slightly. "Innocent people don't need to say it twice" — when I was penalized for repetition, the snark felt unfair because the game forced me into overlapping proof types. The cards I had available all proved the same things.

**K3:** Did KOA's words ever change what you did next? Describe the moment.

Yes. After the contradiction warning in Puzzle 1 ("That doesn't quite line up..."), I became much more cautious about tag conflicts in Puzzles 2 and 3. I started checking opposing tags before committing.

**K4:** How would you describe KOA's personality to a friend? (one sentence)

A passive-aggressive smart home AI that takes household disputes way too seriously.

**K5:** Which of these best describes KOA?
- (a) A fun character I enjoyed interacting with

**K6:** Rate KOA on these dimensions (1-7 scale):
- Funny: 5
- Intimidating: 3
- Memorable: 5
- Fair: 4

**K7:** Would KOA being more reactive (responding specifically to YOUR choices, not generic lines) make the game better?
- (a) Yes, significantly — that would make it feel alive

**K8:** If KOA had a voice, what would it sound like? (open-ended — accent, tone, energy)

Flat, slightly robotic monotone with dry wit. Think GLaDOS but less overtly hostile — more disappointed parent energy. British accent would work well.

**K9:** Did you read all of KOA's dialogue, or did you skip/skim it?
- (a) Read every word

**K10:** What's the most memorable thing KOA said across all 3 puzzles? (quote or paraphrase)

"I'm watching you. And the leftover pad thai."

**S7:** The difficulty progression felt natural. 4

### Clarity
**S8:** When I lost, I understood why. N/A (never lost, but when blocked on Puzzle 3 I did NOT immediately understand why)
**S9:** The feedback after each turn was useful. 5
**S10:** I was confused about what I was supposed to do. *(reverse-scored)* 3

## Part 5: Variety & Session

**V1:** Did the 3 puzzles feel like 3 different experiences, or 3 versions of the same thing?
- (b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles

**V2:** Which puzzle was your favorite and why? (open-ended)

Puzzle 2 (The Thermostat War). It had the cleanest design — the trap card was clearly identifiable, the corroboration opportunity was satisfying to find, and achieving FLAWLESS felt like solving the puzzle perfectly. The phone_gps being AWAY when everything else was HOME was an elegant constraint.

**V3:** Which puzzle was your least favorite and why? (open-ended)

Puzzle 3 (The Missing Remote). The ACTIVE/IDLE conflict felt like it punished you no matter what. After playing smartwatch (the only ALERTNESS card), two of the remaining three cards became dangerous. The "optimal" play (tv_log alone for FLAWLESS) is non-obvious because it requires choosing a pwr-2 card over a pwr-3 card and accepting a contradiction to avoid a repetition. That tradeoff is interesting in theory but hard to discover without post-game analysis.

**V4:** Rank the 3 puzzles from easiest to hardest: 1. Thermostat War 2. Last Slice 3. Missing Remote

**V5:** Did you notice different puzzle mechanics (traps, counters, corroboration)? What did you notice? (open-ended)

Yes. Every puzzle has: (1) a trap card — highest power but with a tag that conflicts with most of the hand and/or high risk; (2) a refutation card that pairs with a contested card; (3) corroboration opportunities from same-tag, different-source pairs. The core pattern is: refute+corroborate on Turn 1, cover concerns on Turn 2, clean up damage on Turn 3. The variation comes from which cards conflict and whether the concern coverage forces you into contradictions.

**V6:** How did the 3-puzzle session compare to replaying the same puzzle?
- (a) Much better — variety kept me engaged

## Part 6: Product & Market

**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
- (c) Both

**M2:** Would you pay for this game?
- (c) $1-2 one-time

**M3:** What would make you pay a monthly subscription? Pick all that apply.
- (a) New puzzles every day
- (b) Longer story cases (multi-act investigations)

**M4:** How did the 3-puzzle session feel in terms of length?
- (b) Just right

**M5:** How long did the full session feel?
- (c) 10-15 minutes

**M6:** Where would you play this?
- (a) Phone app

**M7:** How often would you want to play this?
- (b) A few times a week

**M8:** When did the game "click" for you — when did you feel like you understood the system?
- (b) After losing or winning Puzzle 1

**M9:** What game or experience does this remind you of most? (open-ended — e.g. Wordle, Sudoku, Phoenix Wright, a card game, something else)

A mashup of Slay the Spire (card optimization under constraints) and Phoenix Wright (narrative evidence presentation). The domestic setting makes it feel like a cozy puzzle game, which is a nice contrast to the mechanical depth.

**M10:** Complete this sentence: "This game is ___." (one phrase)

"This game is a satisfying logic puzzle wrapped in a petty roommate argument."

**M11:** Would you tell a friend about KOA specifically (not just the game)? (Yes / No)

Yes — KOA's personality is the hook that makes the premise memorable.

**M12:** Is there anything broken, unfair, or confusing we haven't asked about? (open-ended)

Three things:
1. The tag opposition system is never explained. You have to infer that HOME/AWAY, ASLEEP/AWAKE, etc. are conflicting pairs. A brief note in the rules or a visual indicator (color-coding opposing tags) would help first-time players.
2. The contradiction block mechanic (two conflicting cards in one turn = instant block) is surprising. The game says "first contradiction is a warning" but doesn't clarify that this is per-card, not per-turn. Playing two IDLE cards when ACTIVE is committed feels like it should trigger one warning, not a block.
3. The "proves" system creates a tension where you sometimes need to play cards that re-prove an already-addressed concern just for damage, incurring repetition penalty. Cards with no "proves" (like motion_sensor in Puzzle 2) are strategically valuable precisely because they avoid this — but that feels counterintuitive. Why would "weaker" evidence be better?
