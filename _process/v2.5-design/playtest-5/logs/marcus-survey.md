# Post-Game Survey — Playtest 5 (Marcus)

Complete this AFTER all 3 puzzles. Be honest — critical feedback is more valuable than praise.

## Part 1: Open-Ended First (answer before reading the rest of the survey)

**O1:** Describe your experience in 2-3 sentences. What stood out?

Really satisfying puzzle game. The core loop of matching evidence tags and managing contradictions clicked fast. What stood out most was the tension between wanting to play high-power cards and needing to keep your story consistent — the phone_gps in Puzzle 2 was an obvious trap and it felt great to dodge it.

**O2:** What was the single best moment across all 3 puzzles?

Getting the FLAWLESS badge on Puzzle 2. I figured out the refute-first strategy, avoided the decoy card entirely, and the scrutiny breakdown confirmed I played it perfectly. That felt earned.

**O3:** What was the single worst moment across all 3 puzzles?

Puzzle 3, Turn 2 — getting hit with "repeated-proof" penalty because I paired motion_sensor with smartwatch without realizing motion_sensor proved LOCATION which I'd already covered. KOA saying "you keep circling back" stung because I KNEW better by then but didn't catch it.

**O4:** If you could change one thing about this game, what would it be?

Show which proof types I've already committed somewhere on the status bar. I had to mentally track what I'd proved, and that's where I slipped up in Puzzle 3. A small "Proofs used: IDENTITY, LOCATION" line would help without dumbing it down.

## Part 3: KOA (the investigator)

**K1:** Did KOA make you laugh or smile at any point? If yes, what did KOA say? (quote it if you remember)

Yes — "Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent." That was a great line. Also the ending of Puzzle 1: "I'm watching you. And the leftover pad thai."

**K2:** Did KOA ever annoy you? If yes, what triggered it?

Not really annoy, but "Noted. Continue." felt flat compared to the other lines. When KOA has personality it's great, when it's generic it feels like a system message.

**K3:** Did KOA's words ever change what you did next? Describe the moment.

Yes — in Puzzle 1 when KOA said "That doesn't quite line up" about the speaker card, I realized contradicting tags was bad. That directly informed my strategy for Puzzles 2 and 3 where I avoided playing opposing tags.

**K4:** How would you describe KOA's personality to a friend? (one sentence)

A sarcastic smart-home AI detective who's annoyed that you keep having good alibis.

**K5:** Which of these best describes KOA?
- (a) A fun character I enjoyed interacting with

**K6:** Rate KOA on these dimensions (1-7 scale):
- Funny: 5
- Intimidating: 3
- Memorable: 5
- Fair: 6

**K7:** Would KOA being more reactive (responding specifically to YOUR choices, not generic lines) make the game better?
- (a) Yes, significantly — that would make it feel alive

**K8:** If KOA had a voice, what would it sound like? (open-ended — accent, tone, energy)

Dry, slightly robotic but with human-like exasperation. Think GLaDOS but less evil, more bureaucratic. Slightly monotone delivery that makes the jokes funnier.

**K9:** Did you read all of KOA's dialogue, or did you skip/skim it?
- (a) Read every word

**K10:** What's the most memorable thing KOA said across all 3 puzzles? (quote or paraphrase)

"Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent." — perfect character beat.

## Part 5: Variety & Session

**V1:** Did the 3 puzzles feel like 3 different experiences, or 3 versions of the same thing?
- (b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles

**V2:** Which puzzle was your favorite and why? (open-ended)

Puzzle 2 (Thermostat War) — it was the one where everything clicked. I read the cards, saw the trap, built a plan, and executed it perfectly. FLAWLESS felt incredible.

**V3:** Which puzzle was your least favorite and why? (open-ended)

Puzzle 3 (Missing Remote) — not because it was bad, but because I felt like I should have done better. The repetition penalty caught me off guard even though I'd seen the mechanic before. Also felt the most similar to Puzzle 2 structurally (same refute-first pattern).

**V4:** Rank the 3 puzzles from easiest to hardest: 1. Thermostat War 2. Missing Remote 3. Last Slice

**V5:** Did you notice different puzzle mechanics (traps, counters, corroboration)? What did you notice? (open-ended)

Yes:
- Corroboration: matching tags in a turn = bonus damage. Different sources = even bigger bonus.
- Contradictions: playing opposing tags (ASLEEP then AWAKE, HOME then AWAY) costs scrutiny. First one is a warning, second blocks the turn.
- Repetition: proving the same proof type twice adds scrutiny.
- Counters/Contested: some cards are weakened (half damage) until you play the refuter card.
- Refutation: REFUTES cards cancel counter-evidence AND offset their own risk scrutiny.
- Decoy cards: high power but bad tags that will wreck your story (phone_gps in both P1 and P2).

**V6:** How did the 3-puzzle session compare to replaying the same puzzle?
- (a) Much better — variety kept me engaged

## Part 6: Product & Market

**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
- (c) Both

**M2:** Would you pay for this game?
- (c) $1-2 one-time

**M3:** What would make you pay a monthly subscription? Pick all that apply.
- (a) New puzzles every day
- (c) Leaderboards / competitive rankings

**M4:** How did the 3-puzzle session feel in terms of length?
- (b) Just right

**M5:** How long did the full session feel?
- (b) 5-10 minutes

**M6:** Where would you play this?
- (a) Phone app

**M7:** How often would you want to play this?
- (b) A few times a week

**M8:** When did the game "click" for you — when did you feel like you understood the system?
- (b) After losing or winning Puzzle 1

**M9:** What game or experience does this remind you of most? (open-ended — e.g. Wordle, Sudoku, Phoenix Wright, a card game, something else)

Phoenix Wright meets Wordle. The evidence-presenting is very Ace Attorney, but the tight 3-turn structure with daily-puzzle potential feels like Wordle. Also reminds me a little of Slay the Spire with the card synergy stuff.

**M10:** Complete this sentence: "This game is ___." (one phrase)

"This game is a smart little alibi puzzle that rewards paying attention."

**M11:** Would you tell a friend about KOA specifically (not just the game)? (Yes / No)

Yes — KOA's personality is a hook. "There's this sarcastic AI detective you have to convince" is a good pitch.

**M12:** Is there anything broken, unfair, or confusing we haven't asked about? (open-ended)

The forced contradiction in Puzzle 1 felt slightly unfair — the speaker is the ONLY card that proves INTENT, and it's AWAKE, but you've been proving ASLEEP. There's no way to avoid the conflict penalty. That said, it only cost me FLAWLESS not the win, so maybe that's intentional design tension. Also, Puzzles 2 and 3 felt structurally very similar (refuter + contested card pattern). Would like to see more variety in the puzzle shapes — maybe one where the refuter ISN'T obvious, or where you have to choose between two counters.
