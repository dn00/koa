# Post-Game Survey — Playtest 5 (David)

Complete this AFTER all 3 puzzles. Be honest --- critical feedback is more valuable than praise.

## Part 1: Open-Ended First (answer before reading the rest of the survey)

**O1:** Describe your experience in 2-3 sentences. What stood out?

The game rewards systematic analysis. Each puzzle is a constraint-satisfaction problem: maximize damage while minimizing scrutiny, with tag compatibility acting as the primary constraint. What stood out most was the corroboration mechanic --- discovering that same-tag pairs yield bonus damage was satisfying, and it immediately became my primary strategy.

**O2:** What was the single best moment across all 3 puzzles?

Getting FLAWLESS on Puzzle 2. I had internalized the refutation + corroboration opening from Puzzle 1, identified the trap card (phone_gps with AWAY tag), and executed cleanly. It felt like applying a debugging methodology to a new codebase --- same patterns, different data.

**O3:** What was the single worst moment across all 3 puzzles?

Puzzle 3, Attempt 1: playing smartwatch (ACTIVE) + doorbell_cam (IDLE) and getting hit with conflict(1). I did not know ACTIVE and IDLE were opposing tags. The game never told me which tags oppose each other. That felt like a hidden rule rather than a discoverable mechanic.

**O4:** If you could change one thing about this game, what would it be?

Show the opposition axes somewhere. Even a subtle hint like color-coding tags or grouping them in pairs (ASLEEP/AWAKE, HOME/AWAY, ACTIVE/IDLE, ALONE/ACCOMPANIED) would let players reason about contradictions without memorizing an undocumented lookup table.

## Part 2: Puzzle-by-Puzzle Reactions

### Puzzle 1
- Outcome: WIN (reason: all concerns addressed, resistance broken)
- Badge (if won): THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence --- what happened: Grouped HOME cards turn 1 for corroboration + refutation, ASLEEP cards turn 2 for big damage, then ate a contradiction on turn 3 to address INTENT with the only AWAKE card available.

### Puzzle 2
- Outcome: WIN (reason: all concerns addressed, resistance broken)
- Badge (if won): FLAWLESS
- Scrutiny: 2/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence --- what happened: Applied lessons from Puzzle 1 --- led with refuter + corroboration pair, avoided the AWAY trap card entirely, used a no-proves filler card to finish.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 1? Yes --- I had hypotheses to test about the mechanics.

### Puzzle 3
- Outcome: WIN (reason: all concerns addressed, resistance broken)
- Badge (if won): THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence --- what happened: Discovered ACTIVE/IDLE opposition the hard way on first attempt, then optimized card ordering on second attempt but still hit scrutiny 3 due to unavoidable repetition penalties.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 2? Yes --- wanted to see if I could maintain FLAWLESS streak.

## Part 3: KOA (the investigator)

**K1:** Did KOA make you laugh or smile at any point? If yes, what did KOA say? (quote it if you remember)

"Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent." --- This was well-timed. I had just played my best corroboration pair and KOA acknowledged it grudgingly. Good feedback loop.

**K2:** Did KOA ever annoy you? If yes, what triggered it?

"Innocent people don't need to say it twice." --- This triggered when I repeated a proof type, which was sometimes unavoidable due to card constraints. Being told I sound rehearsed when I had no alternative card felt unfair.

**K3:** Did KOA's words ever change what you did next? Describe the moment.

"Hmm. That doesn't quite line up... I'll let it slide this time." After Puzzle 1 Turn 3, this warning made me actively avoid contradictions in Puzzle 2. It directly shaped my Puzzle 2 strategy of dodging the AWAY card.

**K4:** How would you describe KOA's personality to a friend? (one sentence)

A mildly sarcastic detective who gives you just enough rope to hang yourself, but respects clean evidence.

**K5:** Which of these best describes KOA?
- (a) A fun character I enjoyed interacting with

**K6:** Rate KOA on these dimensions (1-7 scale):
- Funny: 5
- Intimidating: 3
- Memorable: 5
- Fair: 5

**K7:** Would KOA being more reactive (responding specifically to YOUR choices, not generic lines) make the game better?
- (b) Somewhat --- nice to have but not essential

**K8:** If KOA had a voice, what would it sound like? (open-ended --- accent, tone, energy)

Dry, low-energy monotone with occasional sharp inflections. Think a tired but competent detective who has seen too many midnight snack incidents. Something like a deadpan podcast host.

**K9:** Did you read all of KOA's dialogue, or did you skip/skim it?
- (a) Read every word

**K10:** What's the most memorable thing KOA said across all 3 puzzles? (quote or paraphrase)

"Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent."

## Part 5: Variety & Session

**V1:** Did the 3 puzzles feel like 3 different experiences, or 3 versions of the same thing?
- (b) Somewhat different --- same core loop but new wrinkles

**V2:** Which puzzle was your favorite and why? (open-ended)

Puzzle 2 (Thermostat War). It was the cleanest puzzle --- the trap card was clearly identifiable, the refutation path was elegant, and achieving FLAWLESS felt like solving a well-designed optimization problem. The constraint space was tight but fair.

**V3:** Which puzzle was your least favorite and why? (open-ended)

Puzzle 3 (Missing Remote). The ACTIVE/IDLE opposition was not hinted at anywhere, and the puzzle seems designed to cap at THOROUGH regardless of play quality. Every path I could find converges on scrutiny 3. If FLAWLESS is impossible, it feels like a ceiling the player can't break through, which is frustrating for an optimizer.

**V4:** Rank the 3 puzzles from easiest to hardest: 1. Thermostat War 2. Last Slice 3. Missing Remote

**V5:** Did you notice different puzzle mechanics (traps, counters, corroboration)? What did you notice? (open-ended)

Yes --- all of them. Corroboration (same-tag bonus) was discovered Turn 1 Puzzle 1. Contradiction (opposing tags) was discovered Turn 3 Puzzle 1. Repetition (re-proving same type) was discovered Turn 2 Puzzle 2. Refutation (REFUTES keyword cancels counters and offsets scrutiny) was discovered Turn 1 Puzzle 1. I also discovered that playing two same-tagged cards that both oppose a committed tag causes an immediate BLOCK (not a warning), because the contradiction counter increments on the first card and the second card sees the incremented counter. Edge case: this means a pair of IDLE cards is inherently unplayable after any ACTIVE card.

**V6:** How did the 3-puzzle session compare to replaying the same puzzle?
- (a) Much better --- variety kept me engaged

## Part 6: Product & Market

**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
- (a) Daily puzzle --- one new puzzle per day

**M2:** Would you pay for this game?
- (c) $1-2 one-time

**M3:** What would make you pay a monthly subscription? Pick all that apply.
- (a) New puzzles every day
- (c) Leaderboards / competitive rankings

**M4:** How did the 3-puzzle session feel in terms of length?
- (b) Just right

**M5:** How long did the full session feel?
- (c) 10-15 minutes

**M6:** Where would you play this?
- (a) Phone app

**M7:** How often would you want to play this?
- (b) A few times a week

**M8:** When did the game "click" for you --- when did you feel like you understood the system?
- (b) After losing or winning Puzzle 1

**M9:** What game or experience does this remind you of most? (open-ended --- e.g. Wordle, Sudoku, Phoenix Wright, a card game, something else)

It reminds me of a simplified Slay the Spire encounter mixed with Phoenix Wright logic puzzles. The card selection with tag constraints feels like deckbuilding combat, but the narrative framing of "convince an investigator" gives it a courtroom drama flavor.

**M10:** Complete this sentence: "This game is ___." (one phrase)

"This game is a logic puzzle disguised as a card game."

**M11:** Would you tell a friend about KOA specifically (not just the game)? (Yes / No)

No --- KOA is pleasant but not distinctive enough to be the selling point. The mechanics are the draw.

**M12:** Is there anything broken, unfair, or confusing we haven't asked about? (open-ended)

1. Tag opposition pairs are not documented anywhere in the briefing. Players must discover ASLEEP/AWAKE, HOME/AWAY, ACTIVE/IDLE, and ALONE/ACCOMPANIED through trial and error. The first two pairs are intuitive; ACTIVE/IDLE is not.

2. The double-contradiction block on same-tag pairs is a subtle edge case. If you play two IDLE cards after committing ACTIVE, the first card triggers the warning and the second card causes a full block. The player loses their turn attempt with no way to predict this from the UI. Consider: should the warning apply to the whole pair, not per-card?

3. Puzzle 3 appears to have a THOROUGH ceiling --- I could not find any card ordering that achieves scrutiny <= 2 with all concerns addressed. If this is intentional, it might frustrate completionists. If it is unintentional, it is a balance bug.

4. The "proves" field on cards like fitbit (ALERTNESS) and security_cam (LIVENESS) don't match any concern in Puzzle 1. This means those cards contribute damage but not progress on concerns. This could confuse players who expect every "proves" to matter. Consider labeling concern-relevant proofs differently from non-concern proofs.

5. Minor: when a turn is blocked by contradiction, the game says "Turn not consumed --- try different cards" but in a non-interactive pipe context this effectively ends the game. Not a real-world issue if the game is interactive, but worth noting for automated testing.
