# Post-Game Survey — Playtest 5 (Jen)

Complete this AFTER all 3 puzzles. Be honest — critical feedback is more valuable than praise.

## Part 1: Open-Ended First (answer before reading the rest of the survey)

**O1:** Describe your experience in 2-3 sentences. What stood out?

The game is a tight optimization puzzle disguised as a narrative interrogation. What stood out most was discovering the corroboration mechanic — pairing same-tag, different-source cards for bonus damage felt like finding a hidden combo. The tension between needing to address all concerns and managing scrutiny created genuinely interesting decisions.

**O2:** What was the single best moment across all 3 puzzles?

Turn 1 of Puzzle 3 — playing smart_lock + wifi_log and seeing 11 damage (8 base + 3 corroboration) with 0 scrutiny thanks to the refutation cancelling the risk. It felt like I had cracked the system. Winning in 2 turns was deeply satisfying.

**O3:** What was the single worst moment across all 3 puzzles?

My first failed attempt at Puzzle 1, when I played speaker (AWAKE) on turn 1, then security_cam (ASLEEP) on turn 2 which triggered a contradiction warning, and then fitbit (ASLEEP) was blocked on turn 3 because I had already used my one warning. I was stuck with only phone_gps (AWAKE, risk 2) which would have maxed my scrutiny. It felt like a dead end with no recovery.

**O4:** If you could change one thing about this game, what would it be?

The contradiction mechanic feels binary and punishing — one warning then hard block. I would prefer a graduated cost (escalating scrutiny) rather than an outright block. Being locked out of entire card categories with no recourse felt more frustrating than strategic.

## Part 2: Puzzle-by-Puzzle Reactions

### Puzzle 1
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge (if won): THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: After a failed first attempt taught me about contradictions, I restructured to corroborate HOME cards first, then ASLEEP cards, accepting one unavoidable AWAKE conflict for the only INTENT card.

### Puzzle 2
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge (if won): FLAWLESS
- Scrutiny: 2/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: Avoided the high-risk phone_gps decoy entirely, used the refute+corroborate opener, and accepted a planned repetition penalty on the last turn.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 1? (Yes / No / Unsure) Yes — I wanted to apply what I learned about corroboration and contradictions.

### Puzzle 3
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge (if won): FLAWLESS
- Scrutiny: 2/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: Won in just 2 turns using the corroboration opener for 11 damage, then accepted an ACTIVE/IDLE conflict to close out concerns.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 2? (Yes / No / Unsure) Yes — I felt confident and wanted to see if my strategy generalized.

## Part 3: KOA (the investigator)

**K1:** Did KOA make you laugh or smile at any point? If yes, what did KOA say? (quote it if you remember)

Yes. "Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent." — felt like KOA was grudgingly impressed, which was funny.

**K2:** Did KOA ever annoy you? If yes, what triggered it?

"Innocent people don't need to say it twice" (repetition penalty dialogue) felt slightly unfair since I had no choice but to prove LOCATION again for damage. The moralizing tone when the penalty was mechanically unavoidable was mildly irritating.

**K3:** Did KOA's words ever change what you did next? Describe the moment.

Not directly — I was planning based on numbers, not KOA's words. But the contradiction warning ("That doesn't quite line up...") in my failed Puzzle 1 attempt made me completely restructure my approach for the retry.

**K4:** How would you describe KOA's personality to a friend? (one sentence)

A dry, slightly smug AI detective who's annoyed when you prove your innocence but reluctantly admits it.

**K5:** Which of these best describes KOA?
- (a) A fun character I enjoyed interacting with
- (b) A neutral game system that delivers results
- (c) An annoying obstacle
- (d) Didn't really notice KOA

**(a)** — KOA's personality added flavor to what would otherwise be a pure numbers game.

**K6:** Rate KOA on these dimensions (1-7 scale):
- Funny: 4
- Intimidating: 2
- Memorable: 5
- Fair: 5

**K7:** Would KOA being more reactive (responding specifically to YOUR choices, not generic lines) make the game better?
- (a) Yes, significantly — that would make it feel alive
- (b) Somewhat — nice to have but not essential
- (c) No — the current level is fine
- (d) No — I'd prefer less KOA, more game

**(b)** — The dialogue is fine but it's clearly template-driven. More specificity would be nice but I'm mostly focused on the mechanics.

**K8:** If KOA had a voice, what would it sound like? (open-ended — accent, tone, energy)

Flat, measured, slightly robotic with dry wit. Think a Roomba that judges you. Monotone with occasional inflection on punchlines.

**K9:** Did you read all of KOA's dialogue, or did you skip/skim it?
- (a) Read every word
- (b) Read most of it
- (c) Skimmed — focused on the numbers
- (d) Skipped — just looked at results

**(a)** — Read every word. First time playing, I wanted to understand everything.

**K10:** What's the most memorable thing KOA said across all 3 puzzles? (quote or paraphrase)

"Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent." — it acknowledged my strategy, which felt rewarding.

## Part 5: Variety & Session

**V1:** Did the 3 puzzles feel like 3 different experiences, or 3 versions of the same thing?
- (a) Genuinely different — each required a new approach
- (b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles
- (c) Basically the same — just different card names

**(b)** — The core loop (refute+corroborate opener, manage scrutiny, cover concerns) worked across all three. The card compositions varied but the optimal strategy was similar.

**V2:** Which puzzle was your favorite and why? (open-ended)

Puzzle 1 (The Last Slice) — it had the most interesting tension because the AWAKE/ASLEEP axis created a genuine dilemma. Speaker was the only INTENT card and it forced a conflict. The other puzzles had more straightforward paths once I knew the pattern.

**V3:** Which puzzle was your least favorite and why? (open-ended)

Puzzle 3 (The Missing Remote) — it was too easy once I knew the corroboration pattern. Won in 2 turns. The ACTIVE/IDLE conflict was a surprise but didn't matter because I had already built up so much damage.

**V4:** Rank the 3 puzzles from easiest to hardest: 1. Missing Remote 2. Thermostat War 3. The Last Slice

**V5:** Did you notice different puzzle mechanics (traps, counters, corroboration)? What did you notice? (open-ended)

Yes:
- Corroboration: same-tag cards from different sources give +20-30% damage bonus. Diverse sources = 30%.
- Contradictions: opposing tags (AWAKE/ASLEEP, HOME/AWAY, ACTIVE/IDLE) trigger a one-time warning, then block.
- Refutation: cards with REFUTES cancel a counter that contests another card. Also cancels scrutiny up to the risk total.
- Repetition: proving the same proof type twice adds +1 scrutiny.
- Contested cards: deal half damage until refuted.
- Decoy cards: high-power cards with high risk and dangerous tags (phone_gps in puzzles 1 & 2) that tempt greedy play.

**V6:** How did the 3-puzzle session compare to replaying the same puzzle?
- (a) Much better — variety kept me engaged
- (b) About the same
- (c) Worse — I preferred going deeper on one puzzle

**(a)** — Variety kept me engaged, even though the meta-strategy was similar.

- (d) $3-5 one-time
- (e) $1-2/month subscription
- (f) $3-5/month subscription

**(c)** — $1-2 one-time if there's enough puzzle variety. Subscription feels like a lot for a puzzle game.

**M3:** What would make you pay a monthly subscription? Pick all that apply.
- (a) New puzzles every day
- (b) Longer story cases (multi-act investigations)
- (c) Leaderboards / competitive rankings

**(a)** and **(b)**

**M4:** How did the 3-puzzle session feel in terms of length?
- (a) Too short
- (b) Just right

- (d) More than 15 minutes

**(b)** — 5-10 minutes

**M6:** Where would you play this?
- (a) Phone app
- (b) Browser

**(a)** — Phone app, perfect for commute or waiting room.

**M7:** How often would you want to play this?
- (a) Every day
- (b) A few times a week
- (c) Once a week
- (d) Occasionally when bored
- (e) Just once was enough

**(b)** — A few times a week, assuming fresh puzzles.

**M8:** When did the game "click" for you — when did you feel like you understood the system?
- (a) During Puzzle 1
- (b) After losing or winning Puzzle 1
- (c) During Puzzle 2
- (d) During Puzzle 3
- (e) Still figuring it out

**(a)** — During Puzzle 1, after my failed first attempt. The contradiction block taught me the tag system matters.

**M9:** What game or experience does this remind you of most? (open-ended — e.g. Wordle, Sudoku, Phoenix Wright, a card game, something else)

A mix of Slay the Spire (card selection, synergy optimization) and Phoenix Wright (presenting evidence to an authority). The tag-matching feels like a simplified deckbuilder.

**M10:** Complete this sentence: "This game is ___." (one phrase)

"This game is a satisfying logic puzzle with a fun wrapper."

**M11:** Would you tell a friend about KOA specifically (not just the game)? (Yes / No)

Yes — KOA's dry personality is a good hook for describing the game.

**M12:** Is there anything broken, unfair, or confusing we haven't asked about? (open-ended)

Two things:
1. The "optimal opener" pattern (refuter + contested card, same tag, different sources) works identically across all 3 puzzles. Once discovered, it removes strategic variety. Consider puzzles where the refuter and contested card have different tags, or where the refuter has a cost.
2. Puzzle 3 was solvable in 2 turns, which made it feel like the easiest despite being last. If difficulty is meant to increase, the ordering should change or Puzzle 3 needs higher resistance.
