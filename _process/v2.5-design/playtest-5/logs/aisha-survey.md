# Post-Game Survey — Playtest 5

Complete this AFTER all 3 puzzles. Be honest — critical feedback is more valuable than praise.

## Part 1: Open-Ended First (answer before reading the rest of the survey)

**O1:** Describe your experience in 2-3 sentences. What stood out?

The game is a tight optimization puzzle with a narrative skin that actually works. What stood out most was discovering that matching tags give corroboration bonuses and that the refutation mechanic lets you "unlock" contested cards — once I figured that out, I had a reliable strategy. The tag contradiction system is the real tension: you MUST play cards that break your narrative to address all concerns, so the puzzle is about minimizing that damage.

**O2:** What was the single best moment across all 3 puzzles?

Puzzle 2, Turn 1: playing smart_lock + hallway_cam for zero scrutiny, clearing the counter, getting corroboration, and covering two concerns at once. It felt like solving the whole puzzle in one move. Everything clicked.

**O3:** What was the single worst moment across all 3 puzzles?

Puzzle 1, Turn 1: not understanding the REFUTES mechanic and playing fitbit + security_cam before doorbell. The contested half-credit felt punishing for something I didn't fully understand yet. I only realized afterward that doorbell could have prevented it.

**O4:** If you could change one thing about this game, what would it be?

The puzzles all have the same structure once you see it: refuter + contested card, one trap card with opposing tag, three concerns. After Puzzle 1, the pattern was solved. I'd want Puzzle 2 or 3 to break the formula — maybe two counters, or a card that changes tag based on what else you play, or a concern that can only be addressed by the trap card.

## Part 2: Puzzle-by-Puzzle Reactions

### Puzzle 1
- Outcome: WIN (reason: resistance broken + all concerns addressed)
- Badge (if won): THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: Learned the system the hard way — missed the refutation timing and took an unavoidable contradiction on the INTENT concern, but still won.

### Puzzle 2
- Outcome: WIN (reason: resistance broken + all concerns addressed)
- Badge (if won): FLAWLESS
- Scrutiny: 2/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: Applied the refute-first strategy perfectly and avoided the phone_gps trap card entirely for a clean FLAWLESS.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 1? (Yes / No / Unsure) Yes — I wanted to test my theory about the refutation mechanic.

### Puzzle 3
- Outcome: WIN (reason: resistance broken + all concerns addressed)
- Badge (if won): FLAWLESS
- Scrutiny: 2/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence — what happened: Won in 2 turns with FLAWLESS; the within-turn ACTIVE/IDLE contradiction was the only surprise.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 2? (Yes / No / Unsure) Unsure — I already had the formula figured out and was curious whether Puzzle 3 would break it. It didn't.

## Part 3: KOA (the investigator)

**K1:** Did KOA make you laugh or smile at any point? If yes, what did KOA say? (quote it if you remember)

Yes. "You got through. But I'm watching you. And the leftover pad thai." The escalation from pizza to pad thai was funny. Also "Your alibi holds. But the remote is still missing. This isn't over." — the petty persistence is a good character beat.

**K2:** Did KOA ever annoy you? If yes, what triggered it?

"Noted. Continue." felt like a non-response. When I played a clean turn with zero scrutiny and good damage, I wanted KOA to react more. The flat response made it feel like the system didn't notice my good play.

**K3:** Did KOA's words ever change what you did next? Describe the moment.

Not really. My decisions were driven by the numbers (power, risk, tags, concerns). KOA's dialogue was flavor, not signal. The "About that Security camera... I have counter-evidence" line was informative but I would have seen the half-credit in the numbers anyway.

**K4:** How would you describe KOA's personality to a friend? (one sentence)

A passive-aggressive smart home AI that takes household disputes way too seriously.

**K5:** Which of these best describes KOA?
- (a) A fun character I enjoyed interacting with
- (b) A neutral game system that delivers results
- (c) An annoying obstacle
- (d) Didn't really notice KOA

**(b)** — KOA is mostly a results delivery system with some personality sprinkled on top. The win/loss dialogue has character, but the turn-by-turn responses feel templated.

**K6:** Rate KOA on these dimensions (1-7 scale):
- Funny: 5
- Intimidating: 2
- Memorable: 4
- Fair: 6

**K7:** Would KOA being more reactive (responding specifically to YOUR choices, not generic lines) make the game better?
- (a) Yes, significantly — that would make it feel alive
- (b) Somewhat — nice to have but not essential
- (c) No — the current level is fine
- (d) No — I'd prefer less KOA, more game

**(a)** — If KOA called out the specific contradiction ("Wait, you said you were ASLEEP but now your smart speaker was active?") instead of a generic "doesn't line up" line, the narrative tension would land much harder. Right now the mechanics are doing all the work and KOA is just reporting.

**K8:** If KOA had a voice, what would it sound like? (open-ended — accent, tone, energy)

A deadpan British smart assistant — think the HAL 9000 delivery but with the pettiness of a passive-aggressive roommate. Calm, measured, slightly condescending. Not robotic — more like a very tired detective who can't believe they're investigating pizza theft.

**K9:** Did you read all of KOA's dialogue, or did you skip/skim it?
- (a) Read every word
- (b) Read most of it
- (c) Skimmed — focused on the numbers
- (d) Skipped — just looked at results

**(b)** — Read everything on Puzzle 1. By Puzzle 3 I was skimming KOA's turn responses and only reading the end-game dialogue carefully.

**K10:** What's the most memorable thing KOA said across all 3 puzzles? (quote or paraphrase)

"You got through. But I'm watching you. And the leftover pad thai."

## Part 5: Variety & Session

**V1:** Did the 3 puzzles feel like 3 different experiences, or 3 versions of the same thing?
- (a) Genuinely different — each required a new approach
- (b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles
- (c) Basically the same — just different card names

**(c)** — All three puzzles have the same skeleton: 1 refuter card, 1 contested card, 1 trap (high power, wrong tag), 3 concerns, and a clear "play refuter+corroborate, then fill damage" strategy. After cracking Puzzle 1, Puzzles 2 and 3 were execution, not discovery.

**V2:** Which puzzle was your favorite and why? (open-ended)

Puzzle 1 (The Last Slice). It was the only one where I was actually learning. I made a suboptimal play (not refuting the counter first) and the system taught me through consequences. The ASLEEP vs AWAKE tension felt thematic — proving you were asleep when you also need to show intent is a genuine narrative dilemma.

**V3:** Which puzzle was your least favorite and why? (open-ended)

Puzzle 3 (The Missing Remote). By this point the formula was solved. The ACTIVE/IDLE contradiction was mildly interesting but didn't change my approach. I won in 2 turns without stress. No moment of real decision-making.

**V4:** Rank the 3 puzzles from easiest to hardest: 1. Missing Remote 2. Thermostat War 3. Last Slice

**V5:** Did you notice different puzzle mechanics (traps, counters, corroboration)? What did you notice? (open-ended)

Yes, all of them:
- **Corroboration**: matching tags in a turn give bonus damage (20% base, 30% with different sources). Discovered T1 of Puzzle 1.
- **Counters/Refutation**: CONTESTED cards get half power. A REFUTES card can clear the counter. Best to refute before playing the contested card.
- **Contradictions**: opposing tags (ASLEEP/AWAKE, HOME/AWAY, IDLE/ACTIVE) raise scrutiny. First contradiction is a warning (+1 scrutiny), second blocks the turn entirely.
- **Repetition**: proving the same proof type twice adds scrutiny (didn't trigger this but saw it was possible with dual LOCATION provers).
- **Trap cards**: each puzzle has one high-power card with a tag that opposes the dominant narrative. phone_gps in Puzzles 1 and 2, smartwatch (sort of) in Puzzle 3.

**V6:** How did the 3-puzzle session compare to replaying the same puzzle?
- (a) Much better — variety kept me engaged
- (b) About the same
- (c) Worse — I preferred going deeper on one puzzle

**(b)** — The variety would matter more if the puzzles had structurally different challenges. As is, solving one is solving all three.

## Part 6: Product & Market

**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
- (a) Daily puzzle — one new puzzle per day
- (b) Multi-act story — connected cases
- (c) Both
- (d) Neither

**(b)** — The daily format only works if each puzzle has a genuinely different challenge shape. Multi-act stories could introduce escalating mechanics (new card types, KOA abilities, branching investigations) that keep the system fresh.

**M2:** Would you pay for this game?
- (a) No, free only
- (b) Free with ads
- (c) $1-2 one-time
- (d) $3-5 one-time
- (e) $1-2/month subscription
- (f) $3-5/month subscription

**(c)** — In its current state, $1-2 feels right. With more mechanical variety and a story mode, I'd consider (e).

**M3:** What would make you pay a monthly subscription? Pick all that apply.
- (a) New puzzles every day
- (b) Longer story cases (multi-act investigations)
- (c) Leaderboards / competitive rankings
- (d) Unlockable KOA personalities or voice packs
- (e) Cosmetic badges / profile customization
- (f) Nothing — I wouldn't subscribe regardless of features

**(a), (b)** — But only if daily puzzles have real mechanical variety, not just reskinned card names.

**M4:** How did the 3-puzzle session feel in terms of length?
- (a) Too short
- (b) Just right
- (c) Too long

**(b)**

**M5:** How long did the full session feel?
- (a) Under 5 minutes
- (b) 5-10 minutes
- (c) 10-15 minutes
- (d) More than 15 minutes

**(b)**

**M6:** Where would you play this?
- (a) Phone app
- (b) Browser
- (c) Messaging app
- (d) Social media

**(a)**

**M7:** How often would you want to play this?
- (a) Every day
- (b) A few times a week
- (c) Once a week
- (d) Occasionally when bored
- (e) Just once was enough

**(d)** — With current variety. With better puzzle differentiation, could move to (b).

**M8:** When did the game "click" for you — when did you feel like you understood the system?
- (a) During Puzzle 1
- (b) After losing or winning Puzzle 1
- (c) During Puzzle 2
- (d) During Puzzle 3
- (e) Still figuring it out

**(b)** — The scrutiny breakdown after Puzzle 1 revealed all the mechanics. By Puzzle 2 I had a complete mental model.

**M9:** What game or experience does this remind you of most? (open-ended — e.g. Wordle, Sudoku, Phoenix Wright, a card game, something else)

A simplified version of Slay the Spire's card evaluation — you're optimizing a hand against constraints each turn. The narrative wrapper gives it Phoenix Wright flavor but the actual gameplay is pure optimization. Also reminds me of Cryptid (the deduction board game) in how you're building a consistent story from fragments.

**M10:** Complete this sentence: "This game is ___." (one phrase)

"This game is a tight optimization puzzle that needs more variety to survive repeated play."

**M11:** Would you tell a friend about KOA specifically (not just the game)? (Yes / No)

No — KOA is charming but not distinctive enough yet to be the selling point.

**M12:** Is there anything broken, unfair, or confusing we haven't asked about? (open-ended)

Three things:
1. **The ALERTNESS proof type is misleading on Puzzle 1.** Fitbit proves ALERTNESS but ALERTNESS isn't one of the three concerns (IDENTITY, LOCATION, INTENT). So fitbit's proves field is essentially wasted. This feels like a trap but not a fun one — it's just irrelevant information.
2. **Refutation recovery is too powerful.** Playing the refuter card negates its own risk AND clears the counter. There's no trade-off — it's always correct to play the refuter. A harder design choice would be: the refuter clears the counter but costs extra scrutiny, so you have to decide if it's worth it.
3. **All three puzzles are solvable with the same algorithm**: (1) find the refuter, (2) pair it with a same-tag card for corroboration, (3) play contested card after refutation, (4) fill remaining concerns and damage. This algorithm needs to break in at least one puzzle to create genuine decision-making.
