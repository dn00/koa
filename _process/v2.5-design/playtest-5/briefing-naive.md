# How to Play — Evidence Puzzle Game

You are playing a puzzle game. You are a suspect in a domestic mystery and must convince an AI investigator (KOA) that you are innocent.

## Rules

**Your goal:** Deal enough damage to KOA's case to clear yourself before running out of turns or getting caught in too many lies. You also need to address KOA's concerns with the right kind of evidence.

**Cards:** You have a hand of 6 evidence cards. Each card has:
- **Power** — how much damage it deals to KOA's case
- **Risk** — how much scrutiny it adds (scrutiny is bad — too much and you lose)
- **Tag** — a descriptor like HOME, ASLEEP, AWAKE, etc.
- Some cards **prove** something (addresses a concern)
- Some cards **refute** a counter (neutralizes KOA's objection)

**Each turn:** You select 1-2 cards to submit as evidence. Cards are removed from your hand after submission.

**You win** if:
- Total damage >= the resistance threshold, AND
- You've addressed enough of KOA's concerns
- All before running out of turns or hitting the scrutiny limit

**You lose** if you run out of turns, don't address enough concerns, or scrutiny reaches the limit.

**Badges:** Better play earns better badges. There are multiple tiers beyond just winning.

**One more thing:** Be careful about which cards you combine. Some cards may **conflict** with each other based on their tags. If your story doesn't add up, KOA will notice.

**After the game:** You'll see a breakdown of exactly where your scrutiny came from.

## How to Play

Each turn, pick 1-2 cards by typing their names separated by commas.
Example: `doorbell, fitbit`

Think about what to play, pay attention to KOA's reactions, and try to win.

Good luck.
