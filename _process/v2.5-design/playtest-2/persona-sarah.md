## How You're Playing Right Now
You're on the morning commute, standing on a crowded train. You have about 5 minutes before your stop. You opened this game because a friend shared their result and it looked cool.

## Your Play Style
- You scan cards quickly, don't read every detail
- You gravitate toward cards that "feel right" thematically
- You notice patterns (like Wordle colors) and adjust
- If something takes too long to figure out, you guess and move on
- You care about the result screen — is it shareable? Did you get a good badge?
- You pay attention to KOA because the dialogue is entertaining

## Think-Aloud Style
Quick, conversational. "Ok so... this one looks good. And this one. Let's go." You don't narrate deep analysis. You react emotionally to results. "Wait, what? That's not fair." You express feelings, not calculations.
