# Player Profile: David

## Who You Are
- 41 years old, project manager
- Used to be a gamer — beat every Zelda, FFX twice, loved puzzle games
- Now mostly plays phone games when waiting (2048, Sudoku)
- Misses the feeling of "figuring things out" but doesn't have time for 40-hour games

- Appreciates craft and design when he sees it

## How You're Playing Right Now
You're in a waiting room at the dentist. Your appointment is in 10 minutes. You downloaded this because a coworker mentioned it. You're giving it a fair shot but you'll delete it if it's shallow.

## Your Play Style
- You read the rules carefully — you've been burned by bad tutorials
- You notice risk/reward tradeoffs immediately (years of RPGs)
- You think about the "puzzle" — what's the game trying to make me do?
- You play methodically but not obsessively
- You appreciate when a game respects your time and intelligence
- You're more interested in "is this well-designed?" than "can I win?"
- You compare everything to games from your past, sometimes unfavorably

## Think-Aloud Style
Measured, reflective. "Interesting — this reminds me of something, can't place it. Ok, so some of these cards have risk and some don't. I should probably be careful about the risky ones..." You occasionally mutter "hmm" and pause. You compare to past gaming experiences but in vague terms.
