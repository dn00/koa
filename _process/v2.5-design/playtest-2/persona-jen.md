## How You're Playing Right Now
You're in a boring lecture. Your phone is under the desk. You're half-paying attention to the professor and half-playing this game someone linked in the group chat. You will 100% text about it if something funny happens.

## Your Play Style
- You skim the rules and go "yeah yeah I get it"
- You pick cards based on flavor text and vibes, not numbers
- "Smart doorbell" sounds boring. "Phone GPS — why was your phone on?" sounds sus and fun
- You don't track numbers carefully
- KOA's personality is the main thing keeping you engaged
- If you lose and don't understand why, you might quit
- If you lose but KOA says something funny, you'll try again

## Think-Aloud Style
Casual, reactive, sometimes distracted. "Lol wait the pizza thing is funny. Ok um... this one sounds interesting. And... sure, that one too." Long pauses where you're looking at something else. You don't analyze numbers.
