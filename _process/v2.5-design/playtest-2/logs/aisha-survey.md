## Part 1: Quick Reactions

**QR1:** Analytical

**QR2:** Satisfied

**QR3:** Maybe — I'd want a NEW puzzle. This one I've mapped out.

**QR4:** Yes, clearly

## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale)

### Engagement
**S1:** 6 — I immediately wanted to optimize after Run 1.
**S2:** 7 — I was already mapping decision trees between runs.
**S3:** 3 — Sessions are too short to lose track of time. That's not a criticism.

### Clarity
**S4:** 6 — Win conditions were clear. Scrutiny penalties were not fully transparent.
**S5:** 5 — N/A, I won every time. But I didn't fully understand why scrutiny spiked.
**S6:** 5 — KOA's dialogue hinted at issues but didn't explain the mechanic precisely. I had to infer.

### Depth
**S7:** 6 — Tag grouping vs. concern coverage vs. risk management is a real trade-off.
**S8:** 7 — Corroboration bonus was a Run 3 discovery. ASLEEP/AWAKE conflict was Run 1.
**S9:** 5 — I think I've found the optimal 2-turn line. Not sure there's a FLAWLESS path.

### Frustration
**S10:** 3 — Scrutiny penalties felt slightly opaque but not unfair.
**S11:** 6 — The security_cam rejection was my fault for mixing tags. Good.
**S12:** 3 — The "circling back" penalty on turn 2 felt slightly arbitrary.

### KOA
**S13:** 4 — KOA has personality but only a few lines. More of a system with flavor text.
**S14:** 5 — KOA's rejection of security_cam directly changed my strategy.
**S15:** 6 — Yes, KOA's lines were the primary feedback channel.

### Achievement
**S16:** 6 — Winning felt earned. The badge tier difference felt less clear.
**S17:** 6 — I specifically played Run 3 trying to get FLAWLESS. Couldn't.
**S18:** 5 — Concerns felt like checkboxes. Necessary but not interesting on their own.

### Net Promoter Score
**S19:** 7

## Part 3: Comparisons and Open-Ended

**C1:** Wordle. Short daily puzzle with badge/score optimization and constrained decision space. Also Papers Please for the "prove yourself to an authority" framing.

**C2:** The tag conflict system adds a narrative coherence layer that Wordle doesn't have. You're not just optimizing numbers — you're constructing a consistent story. The corroboration bonus rewards thematic grouping, which is elegant.

**C3:** Wordle has a cleaner feedback loop. In Wordle, you know exactly what each color means. Here, the scrutiny penalties have hidden rules I couldn't fully reverse-engineer in 3 runs. That's either depth or opacity — hard to tell with one puzzle.

**C4:**
- Seeing your hand for the first time: Immediately started categorizing by tag, risk, and concern coverage. Noticed the ASLEEP/AWAKE tension. Noted CONTESTED and REFUTES keywords.
- Making my first submission: Confident — doorbell + fitbit was a safe information-gathering opener.
- Getting KOA's first response: Satisfied. Zero scrutiny, IDENTITY addressed.
- Winning for the first time: Mild satisfaction. THOROUGH badge felt mid-tier. Wanted to optimize.
- Starting Run 2: Focused. Had a specific hypothesis to test (2-turn win, avoid ASLEEP cards).
- Finishing Run 3: Discovered corroboration bonus. Satisfied with understanding but slightly frustrated I couldn't crack FLAWLESS.

**C5:** Run 3, Turn 1 — seeing "8 damage (6 base + 2 corroboration)" when I paired two HOME cards. That revealed a whole mechanic I'd been ignoring. Immediately explained why my Run 1 was suboptimal.

**C6:** How scrutiny accumulates beyond base card risk. There are clearly hidden modifiers (tag conflicts across turns, redundant concern proofs) but the game doesn't surface the breakdown. I want to see "+1 risk (card) +1 conflict penalty" or similar.

**C7:** A new hand with different tag distributions and a harder constraint set. Especially if the optimal line isn't obvious and requires 3+ runs to find.

**C8:** If every puzzle has the same structure (3 turns, same concerns, similar cards) and I can pattern-match the solution type within 2 runs every time.

**C9:** Yes. I cared about badges as proof of mastery. Getting CLEAN twice but not FLAWLESS is mildly irritating in a good way — it suggests there's a solution I haven't found.

**C10:** "This game is basically Wordle but with narrative coherence constraints and resource management."

## Part 4: Product & Market Fit

### Format Preference
**M1:** (c) Both — daily puzzles plus a story mode

**M2:** (d) As long as puzzles stay fresh

**M3:** (a) Yes, if the story hooked me

### Monetization
**M4:** (d) I'd pay $3-5 one-time

**M5:** (a) New daily puzzles, (c) Competitive leaderboards, (d) Harder difficulty modes

**M6:** (c) Would ruin the experience — the sessions are too short for ads to not feel intrusive

### Distribution
**M7:** (b) Browser / web app

**M8:** (b) Only if I got a good badge

**M9:** "There's a puzzle game where you have to construct a logically consistent alibi under constraints. It's short but has real optimization depth."

### Perceived Session Length
**M10:** (a) Under 2 minutes

**M11:** (a) Too short — I wanted more. Each run is very fast once you know the system. A single puzzle should probably have more turns or a larger hand.

### Retention & Habit
**M12:** (b) Lunch break, (e) Procrastinating

**M13:** (a) Push notification, (c) Streak / daily reward system

**M14:** (a) Done — I want a new puzzle now

### Competitive & Social
**M15:** (a) Yes, after I've played — like Wordle comparisons

**M16:** (a) Yes, I'd compete

### Identity & Positioning
**M17:** "A short deduction puzzle where you optimize evidence submission against a suspicious AI investigator."

**M18:** More puzzles with varied constraint structures. The engine is good but one puzzle isn't enough to evaluate depth. I need to see if different hands produce genuinely different optimal strategies.

**M19:** The scrutiny calculation is not transparent enough. I suspect there are hidden penalties for tag conflicts across turns and redundant concern proofs, but the game never confirms or denies this. For a game that rewards optimization, the scoring should be auditable — even if only post-game.

## Part 5: Run Log

### Run 1
- Moves played: T1: doorbell + fitbit | T2: thermostat + speaker | T3: security_cam (rejected) then microwave
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- Badge: THOROUGH
- One sentence: Learned that ASLEEP and AWAKE tags conflict across turns, and security_cam gets rejected after playing AWAKE cards.

### Run 2
- Moves played: T1: doorbell + phone_gps | T2: thermostat + speaker
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 4/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- Badge: CLEAN
- One sentence: Avoided ASLEEP cards entirely and won in 2 turns, but scrutiny was higher than expected due to hidden penalties.

### Run 3
- Moves played: T1: thermostat + doorbell | T2: phone_gps + speaker
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 4/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- Badge: CLEAN
- One sentence: Discovered corroboration bonus from matching tags in same turn (HOME+HOME, AWAKE+AWAKE), which is the key optimization axis — best strategy is group by tag per turn.
