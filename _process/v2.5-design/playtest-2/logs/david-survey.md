## Part 3: Comparisons and Open-Ended

**C1:** Ace Attorney. The evidence-presentation mechanic, the investigator character reacting to your submissions, the narrative framing of a logical puzzle — it all reminds me of presenting evidence in court. But compressed into 3 turns instead of hours.

**C2:** Brevity. Ace Attorney takes forever. This respects my time. I can play a full game in under 2 minutes. That's a huge advantage for someone like me who doesn't have gaming sessions anymore.

**C3:** Narrative depth. Ace Attorney makes you care about the characters and the case. Here, the pizza scenario is charming but lightweight. KOA has personality but I don't feel invested in the relationship yet.

**C4:** Emotional journey:
- Seeing your hand for the first time: Analytical. "OK, let me map out the tags and figure out the constraints."
- Making your first submission: Confident. The HOME+HOME pairing felt like an obvious strong opener.
- Getting KOA's first response: Pleased. The corroboration bonus confirmed my read on tag-matching.
- Winning for the first time: Slightly hollow — I missed a concern and knew it.
- Starting Run 2: Motivated. I had a specific hypothesis to test (AWAKE/ASLEEP conflict).
- Finishing Run 3: Content. I understood the system well enough to feel like I'd "solved" the puzzle space.

**C5:** The moment fitbit+security_cam got REJECTED in Run 2 after I'd already played speaker. That was the "oh!" — the game tracks narrative consistency across turns. ASLEEP evidence contradicts earlier AWAKE evidence. That's when the puzzle clicked from "optimize numbers" to "construct a coherent story."

**C6:** The win condition triggering immediately when resistance breaks, even if you have turns left. I wanted to play speaker on Turn 3 of Run 3 but the game ended after Turn 2. It wasn't clear that I needed to front-load concern coverage. A small note like "game ends when resistance breaks" would help.

**C7:** A new scenario with different evidence cards, different constraints, and a harder puzzle. The mechanical depth is there — I just need variety.

**C8:** Repetition. If the puzzles started feeling samey (same tag conflicts, same optimal structure), I'd lose interest fast. The design needs to keep introducing new wrinkles.

**C9:** Yes, I noticed. I cared enough to play Run 2 specifically to get CLEAN. I didn't achieve THOROUGH or FLAWLESS and I'm curious what those require — probably lower scrutiny + all concerns + fewer turns.

**C10:** "This game is basically Ace Attorney but with Wordle's session length."

## Part 4: Product & Market Fit

### Format Preference
**M1:** (c) Both — daily puzzles plus a story mode

**M2:** (d) As long as puzzles stay fresh

**M3:** (a) Yes, if the story hooked me

### Monetization
**M4:** (d) I'd pay $3-5 one-time

**M5:** (a) New daily puzzles, (e) Story campaigns

**M6:** (d) I'd pay to remove them

### Distribution
**M7:** (a) Phone (iOS/Android app)

**M8:** (b) Only if I got a good badge

**M9:** "It's like a 2-minute puzzle game where you have to build a consistent alibi from evidence cards. Sounds simple but there's actual strategy." I'd tell someone if the puzzles kept surprising me.

### Perceived Session Length
**M10:** (b) 2-5 minutes

**M11:** (b) Just right

### Retention & Habit
**M12:** (c) Waiting / killing time, (b) Lunch break

**M13:** (d) New story content dropped, (a) Push notification

**M14:** (a) Done — I want a new puzzle now

### Competitive & Social
**M15:** (a) Yes, after I've played — like Wordle comparisons

**M16:** (d) Only among friends, not global

### Identity & Positioning
**M17:** "A quick deduction puzzle where you build an alibi from smart home evidence, and the AI investigator catches you if your story doesn't add up."

**M18:** Puzzle variety. The engine is solid, the mechanic is clever, but one scenario isn't enough to judge. It needs 50+ puzzles with escalating complexity — new tags, new conflict rules, multi-step contradictions. The skeleton is great; it needs flesh.

**M19:** The win condition ending the game immediately when resistance breaks felt abrupt. I had a turn left and cards to play. If I'd known, I would have sequenced differently. This isn't "broken" but it's a design choice that should be communicated more clearly upfront.

## Part 5: Run Log

### Run 1
- Moves played (per turn): T1: thermostat+doorbell, T2: fitbit+microwave
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 0/5
- Concerns addressed: 2/3
- Badge: none (basic WIN)
- One sentence: Learned that HOME+HOME corroboration gives bonus damage, and that you can win without addressing all concerns.

### Run 2
- Moves played (per turn): T1: thermostat+doorbell, T2: speaker, T3: phone_gps (after fitbit+security_cam was rejected)
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 4/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- Badge: CLEAN
- One sentence: Learned that AWAKE and ASLEEP tags create hard conflicts — playing speaker locks out fitbit and security_cam — and that replaying an already-addressed concern adds extra scrutiny.

### Run 3
- Moves played (per turn): T1: fitbit+security_cam, T2: thermostat+doorbell
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 1/5
- Concerns addressed: 2/3
- Badge: none (basic WIN)
- One sentence: Learned that leading with ASLEEP cards gives strong corroboration and low scrutiny, but the game ends on resistance break so you must address concerns before that happens.
