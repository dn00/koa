## Part 3: Comparisons and Open-Ended

**C1:** Which of these games does "The Last Slice" remind you of most?
**Wordle** — short daily puzzle, you figure out the trick through repeat plays, satisfying when you nail it, shareable result.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than Wordle?
The theme and narrative. KOA's dialogue makes it feel like you're in a story, not just solving an abstract grid. Also the tradeoff between different win conditions (damage vs concerns vs scrutiny) is more interesting than Wordle's single "guess the word" goal.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than Wordle?
Clarity. With Wordle, you ALWAYS know exactly what the colors mean. Here, I didn't fully understand why scrutiny went up sometimes. The tag conflict system is the core mechanic but it's never explicitly explained — I had to figure it out by trial and error. Also Wordle has that perfect "one more guess" flow. This game can end abruptly when resistance breaks, which felt jarring.

**C4:** Emotional journey:
- Seeing your hand for the first time: "Ok cute, smart home evidence. I can work with this."
- Making your first submission: "Let's gooo, feels good"
- Getting KOA's first response: "Ha, 'that checks out' — I like this investigator"
- Winning for the first time: "Wait already? But I had more to do..."
- Starting Run 2: "Ok NOW I know the trick, gonna nail it"
- Finishing Run 3: "Ugh, went backwards. Should've stuck with Run 2 strategy."

**C5:** What's the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!" across all 3 runs?
Run 2 when KOA said "that doesn't quite line up" — I realized mixing AWAKE and ASLEEP tags was the contradiction, and that the game was tracking my story's consistency. That's when the game clicked.

**C6:** What was the most confusing thing about the game?
Why the game ends immediately when resistance breaks even if I haven't used all my turns. It felt like I was being punished for being TOO effective. Also the difference between "proves" tags (IDENTITY, LOCATION, INTENT) vs card tags (HOME, ASLEEP, AWAKE) wasn't super clear at first glance.

**C7:** What would make you come back tomorrow to play a new puzzle?
A different scenario with new cards and a new mystery. If KOA had new dialogue and the puzzle had a different feel.

**C8:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the puzzles felt samey or if I couldn't figure out the "trick" and just kept losing without understanding why.

**C9:** Did you notice the badge system (WIN/CLEAN/THOROUGH/FLAWLESS)? Did you care?
YES. The badge system was the main reason I replayed. Going from WIN → THOROUGH felt great. Not being able to figure out FLAWLESS was annoying but motivating.

**C10:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically **Wordle** but with **a detective interrogation and card strategy.**"

## Part 4: Product & Market Fit

### Format Preference
**M1:** (c) Both — daily puzzles plus a story mode

**M2:** (b) 1-2 weeks

**M3:** (a) Yes, if the story hooked me

### Monetization
**M4:** (c) I'd pay $1-2 one-time

**M5:** (a) New daily puzzles, (b) New characters / investigators beyond KOA

**M6:** (b) Tolerable if short

### Distribution
**M7:** (a) Phone (iOS/Android app)

**M8:** (b) Only if I got a good badge

**M9:** "It's like Wordle but you're trying to convince a smart home AI you didn't eat the last slice of pizza. It's funny and quick."

### Perceived Session Length
**M10:** (a) Under 2 minutes

**M11:** (a) Too short — I wanted more

### Retention & Habit
**M12:** (a) Morning routine (commute, coffee), (c) Waiting / killing time

**M13:** (b) Friend shared their result, (d) New story content dropped

**M14:** (a) Done — I want a new puzzle now

### Competitive & Social
**M15:** (a) Yes, after I've played — like Wordle comparisons

**M16:** (d) Only among friends, not global

### Identity & Positioning
**M17:** "It's a quick puzzle game where you pick evidence cards to convince an AI investigator you're innocent."

**M18:** More puzzles. One scenario gets stale after 3 plays. The game needs a fresh puzzle daily or a story mode to have staying power.

**M19:** The game ending when resistance breaks feels like a bug, not a feature. If I still have turns and unaddressed concerns, I should get to keep playing. It's the single biggest frustration — the game literally prevents you from getting a better badge by ending too early. Either let me keep playing, or make it clear that breaking resistance early IS the optimal path and concerns are optional.

## Part 5: Run Log

### Run 1
- Moves played (per turn): T1: doorbell+fitbit, T2: thermostat+security_cam
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 1/5
- Concerns addressed: 2/3
- Badge: WIN
- One sentence: I learned the game can end before you use all your turns if you break resistance early.

### Run 2
- Moves played (per turn): T1: doorbell+speaker, T2: thermostat+security_cam
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- Badge: THOROUGH
- One sentence: I changed to playing speaker early to address INTENT before resistance broke, which got all 3 concerns but cost more scrutiny from tag conflicts.

### Run 3
- Moves played (per turn): T1: doorbell+fitbit, T2: thermostat+security_cam (game ended, turn 3 never happened)
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 1/5
- Concerns addressed: 2/3
- Badge: WIN
- One sentence: I went back to the Run 1 strategy hoping to also squeeze in speaker on turn 3, but the game ended at turn 2 again — confirmed the core puzzle tension is that you MUST play the risky INTENT card early.
