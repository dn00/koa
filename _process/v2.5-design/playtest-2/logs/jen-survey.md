## Part 3: Comparisons and Open-Ended

**C1:** Which of these games does "The Last Slice" remind you of most?
Among Us — you're trying to convince someone you're innocent with evidence, and there's this social deduction vibe even though it's single-player.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than Among Us?
You don't need friends online at the same time. Also KOA is funnier than most randoms in Among Us lobbies.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than Among Us?
No social element. The fun of Among Us is lying to real people and watching them freak out. This is more like a puzzle. Also it's over really fast.

**C4:** Emotional journey:
- Seeing your hand for the first time: "Ok there's a lot of cards. The pizza one is funny. Let me just skim these."
- Making your first submission: "Hope this works?? Doorbell and fitbit seemed safe."
- Getting KOA's first response: "Oh nice, KOA accepted it. 'I'll drop that line of questioning' — ok cool cool."
- Winning for the first time: "Wait already?? That was fast. But I only got 2/3 concerns, feels incomplete."
- Starting Run 2: "Ok I actually want to get all 3 concerns this time. Let me think about this more carefully."
- Finishing Run 3: "FLAWLESS BABY. Ok I'm satisfied. That was a good puzzle arc."

**C5:** What's the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"?
When doorbell + thermostat gave me a corroboration bonus (8 damage instead of 6). I was like wait, matching tags give bonus damage?? That changed how I planned everything.

**C6:** What was the most confusing thing about the game?
The scrutiny penalty on Turn 3 of Run 3 when I played fitbit after speaker. I get that AWAKE and ASLEEP conflict but I played them on separate turns, not together. Felt weird that it still triggered. Also the "proves" vs "REFUTES" thing on the doorbell — I didn't really understand REFUTES until after I was done.

**C7:** What would make you come back tomorrow to play a new puzzle?
A new scenario with different vibes. Like "who broke the TV" or "who ate the last cookie" — keep it unhinged and domestic. KOA's personality is the hook.

**C8:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If all the puzzles felt the same. Like if it's always "play the matching tags, avoid conflicts" with no new mechanics. Also if KOA's lines got repetitive.

**C9:** Did you notice the badge system? Did you care?
Yes!! The badge system is literally why I played 3 times. Going from no-badge WIN to THOROUGH to FLAWLESS felt like a progression. I cared way more than I expected to.

**C10:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically Among Us but with smart home devices and no friends needed."

## Part 4: Product & Market Fit

### Format Preference
**M1:** (c) Both — daily puzzles plus a story mode

**M2:** (b) 1-2 weeks

**M3:** (a) Yes, if the story hooked me

### Monetization
**M4:** (c) I'd pay $1-2 one-time

**M5:** (a) New daily puzzles, (b) New characters / investigators beyond KOA, (e) Story campaigns

**M6:** (b) Tolerable if short

### Distribution
**M7:** (a) Phone (iOS/Android app)

**M8:** (b) Only if I got a good badge

**M9:** "Ok so there's this game where a smart home AI interrogates you about eating the last slice of pizza and you have to prove you were asleep using your Fitbit data. It's unhinged."

### Perceived Session Length
**M10:** (a) Under 2 minutes

**M11:** (a) Too short — I wanted more

### Retention & Habit
**M12:** (c) Waiting / killing time, (e) Procrastinating

**M13:** (b) Friend shared their result, (d) New story content dropped

**M14:** (a) Done — I want a new puzzle now

### Competitive & Social
**M15:** (a) Yes, after I've played — like Wordle comparisons

**M16:** (d) Only among friends, not global

### Identity & Positioning
**M17:** "It's a puzzle game where you convince a sassy AI you didn't eat the pizza by showing it your smart home data."

**M18:** More puzzles. Different scenarios. The mechanics are solid but one puzzle isn't a game, it's a demo.

**M19:** The game ended mid-run in Run 1 before I could play turn 3 — I won but missed the INTENT concern. It felt like the game cut me off. Maybe let the player keep going even after resistance breaks if they haven't addressed all concerns? Or at least tell me "you won but you missed some concerns, try again for a better badge." The ending was abrupt.

## Part 5: Run Log

- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 1/5

- One sentence: I learned that the game ends as soon as resistance breaks, even if you haven't addressed all concerns.

### Run 2

- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- Badge: THOROUGH
- One sentence: I paired INTENT with ASLEEP cards (speaker+security_cam) which caused a tag conflict and extra scrutiny — learned not to mix AWAKE and ASLEEP.

### Run 3

- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 2/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
