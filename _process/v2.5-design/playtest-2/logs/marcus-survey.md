## Part 3: Comparisons and Open-Ended

**C1:** Which of these games does "The Last Slice" remind you of most?
**Wordle** — short puzzle, fixed hand, replay to optimize, badge/score as feedback loop. But with more mechanical depth than Wordle.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked in C1?
More meaningful decisions per session. Wordle has one decision per guess. This has card selection, pairing strategy, tag management, concern coverage — multiple axes of optimization in a single puzzle.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked in C1?
Shareability and clarity of outcome. Wordle's colored grid is instantly parseable. "I got THOROUGH" means nothing to someone who hasn't played. Also, Wordle's difficulty curve is clearer — you know exactly where you stand after each guess.

**C4:** Emotional journey:
- Seeing your hand for the first time: **Intrigued.** Immediately started categorizing by tag and concern coverage. Noticed the ASLEEP/AWAKE tension right away.
- Making your first submission: **Confident.** doorbell+thermostat felt like the obvious opener. Two HOME cards, covers two concerns.
- Getting KOA's first response: **Pleased.** The corroboration bonus was a nice reward for matching tags. KOA's dialogue felt appropriately terse.
- Winning for the first time: **Unsatisfied.** Won in 2 turns with 0 scrutiny but missed INTENT. No badge shown. Felt like I brute-forced it instead of solving it properly.
- Starting Run 2: **Determined.** Clear goal: address all 3 concerns. Restructured my entire plan around fitting speaker into the sequence without blowing scrutiny.
- Finishing Run 3: **Content but curious.** Got CLEAN badge, but I'm not sure I understand the badge hierarchy. Is FLAWLESS even achievable? That question lingers.

**C5:** What's the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!" across all 3 runs?
Run 2, Turn 3: Playing fitbit (ASLEEP) after speaker (AWAKE) and seeing +2 scrutiny with KOA saying "that doesn't match." Suddenly the tag conflict system clicked — your narrative has to be internally consistent across turns. That's elegant.

**C6:** What was the most confusing thing about the game?
The badge hierarchy. Run 2 gave THOROUGH (3 concerns, 3 scrutiny, 3 turns). Run 3 gave CLEAN (3 concerns, 4 scrutiny, 2 turns). I expected CLEAN to mean low scrutiny, but it seems to reward fewer turns instead. The names don't clearly communicate what they measure. Also, Run 1 had no badge at all despite being a win — that felt like missing feedback.

**C7:** What would make you come back tomorrow to play a new puzzle?
A new scenario with different cards, different tag interactions, and a harder constraint set. Ideally with a mechanic I haven't seen yet — maybe a card that changes mid-game, or KOA presenting counter-evidence that forces me to react.

**C8:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If every puzzle has the same structure (same number of turns, same concern types, same tag-conflict rules). The system is elegant but shallow if the puzzle design doesn't evolve.

**C9:** Did you notice the badge system (WIN/CLEAN/THOROUGH/FLAWLESS)? Did you care?
Absolutely noticed, absolutely cared. It was the primary driver for Runs 2 and 3. But I never figured out how to get FLAWLESS, and the game gave me no hints about what I was missing. That's frustrating for an optimizer.

**C10:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically **Wordle** but with **a hand of cards and narrative consistency constraints.**"

## Part 4: Product & Market Fit

### Format Preference
**M1:** (c) Both — daily puzzles plus a story mode

**M2:** (d) As long as puzzles stay fresh

**M3:** (a) Yes, if the story hooked me

### Monetization
**M4:** (d) I'd pay $3-5 one-time

**M5:** (a) New daily puzzles, (b) New characters / investigators beyond KOA, (e) Story campaigns

**M6:** (c) Would ruin the experience — the game is about immersion in a tense interrogation. An ad between runs would break that completely.

### Distribution
**M7:** (b) Browser / web app

**M8:** (b) Only if I got a good badge

**M9:** "It's like Wordle but you're constructing an alibi. There's this interrogator AI and you have to play evidence cards without contradicting yourself. The tag system is really clever."

### Perceived Session Length
**M10:** (b) 2-5 minutes

**M11:** (b) Just right

### Retention & Habit
**M12:** (d) Winding down before bed, (e) Procrastinating

**M13:** (d) New story content dropped

**M14:** (a) Done — I want a new puzzle now

### Competitive & Social
**M15:** (a) Yes, after I've played — like Wordle comparisons

**M16:** (d) Only among friends, not global

### Identity & Positioning
**M17:** "It's a daily deduction puzzle where you build an alibi from evidence cards while keeping your story consistent."

**M18:** More puzzles. The engine is solid. One puzzle isn't a game — it's a demo. The moment there are 30+ unique scenarios with different card pools and mechanics, this becomes something I'd play daily.

**M19:** The game ending immediately when resistance breaks — even if you have turns and concerns left — feels like a bug, not a feature. In Run 1, I couldn't address INTENT because the game ended after turn 2. If the win condition requires concerns, the game should let me keep playing until I've had the chance to address them. Also, the run1 log file didn't record a badge even though I won, which made me wonder if winning without all concerns was even a "real" win.

## Part 5: Run Log

### Run 1
- Moves played (per turn): T1: doorbell+thermostat, T2: fitbit+microwave
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 0/5
- Concerns addressed: 2/3
- Badge (if won): None displayed
- One sentence: Learned that the game ends when resistance breaks, regardless of remaining concerns — efficiency can work against you.

### Run 2
- Moves played (per turn): T1: doorbell+thermostat, T2: speaker+microwave, T3: fitbit
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- Badge (if won): THOROUGH
- One sentence: Changed plan to address INTENT before breaking resistance, but learned that ASLEEP after AWAKE creates tag contradictions that spike scrutiny.

### Run 3
- Moves played (per turn): T1: doorbell+thermostat, T2: speaker+phone_gps
- Outcome: WIN
- Final scrutiny: 4/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- Badge (if won): CLEAN
- One sentence: Paired two AWAKE cards for massive corroboration but redundant LOCATION proof added scrutiny — the game rewards narrative diversity, not just tag matching.
