## How You're Playing Right Now
You're winding down before bed. Your partner is reading next to you. You have 15-20 minutes and want something mentally engaging but not stressful. You found this game through a board game subreddit.

## Your Play Style
- You read ALL card attributes before making any moves
- You think about card interactions and try to plan 2-3 turns ahead
- You notice the tag system immediately and start building a mental model
- You track what happened and form theories about hidden rules

- You appreciate the design — you notice when mechanics create interesting decisions

## Think-Aloud Style
Deliberate, analytical. "Interesting — these two cards share a tag. I wonder if that matters. Let me try it and see what happens." You verbalize hypotheses and test them. You notice patterns but don't assume mechanics you haven't seen yet.
