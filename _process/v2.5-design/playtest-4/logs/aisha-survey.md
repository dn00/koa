# Post-Game Survey — Playtest 4 — Aisha (PT4, Session 3)

---

## Part 1: Open-Ended First

**O1:** The system is elegant but approachable. The refutation-recovery mechanic and corroboration bonuses create genuine decision trees, and the scrutiny breakdown post-game is the single best addition since PT3. Three puzzles in, though, I can find the optimal line within one play of each new puzzle. The ceiling feels close.

**O2:** Puzzle 1, Turn 2 — watching the ASLEEP corroboration with diverse sources deal 12 damage (9 base + 3 bonus) and obliterate 9 resistance in one shot. The refutation from T1 enabling that by uncontesting security_cam was a satisfying two-turn setup.

**O3:** Puzzle 3 — realizing after I won with THOROUGH that I could have trivially gotten FLAWLESS by playing smartwatch alone T2 and tv_log T3 instead of greedily closing in 2 turns. That's a discipline check, which is fine, but the fact that I could solve the puzzle to FLAWLESS in my head immediately post-game means the puzzle didn't resist my analysis enough.

**O4:** Increase the decision space. Right now, 6 cards over 3 turns with 2-card max means at most 6 cards played. Every card gets used. There is no hand management — no real sacrifice. I want puzzles where I genuinely cannot play everything and must choose what to leave behind. Also: add at least one puzzle where the tag conflict axis isn't binary (more than two opposing pairs active simultaneously), so the contradiction calculus has more edges.

## Part 2: Puzzle-by-Puzzle Reactions

### Puzzle 1: The Last Slice
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Executed the refute-first, ASLEEP-corroborate, speaker-last line; the ASLEEP/AWAKE contradiction is structural and unavoidable, making FLAWLESS likely impossible on this puzzle — which is good design.

### Puzzle 2: The Thermostat War
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: FLAWLESS
- Scrutiny: 2/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Identified the refute-first pattern from Puzzle 1, applied it, managed repetition risk by accepting it on T2 and keeping T3 clean with motion_sensor.
- **Between puzzles:** Yes — I wanted to verify whether FLAWLESS was achievable and whether the refutation mechanic was consistent across puzzles.

### Puzzle 3: The Missing Remote
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Won in 2 turns but suboptimally — FLAWLESS at scrutiny 1 was achievable with a 3-turn line (smartwatch solo T2, tv_log T3) that I identified immediately post-game.
- **Between puzzles:** Yes, but with diminishing enthusiasm — I suspected the puzzle structure would be similar, and it was.

## Part 3: KOA (the investigator)

**K1:** "Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent." — That one landed. It acknowledged a deliberate strategic choice (source diversity for 30% bonus) with a reaction that felt specific.

**K2:** No. KOA's dialogue is compact and stays out of the way.

**K3:** No. I make decisions based on the numbers. KOA's dialogue is post-hoc flavor, not information-bearing. The one exception is the contradiction warning, which confirms a system state change — but I already knew from the tag conflict that it would fire.

**K4:** A dry, slightly exasperated smart home AI that tries to be intimidating but mostly just annotates your math.

**K5:** (b) A neutral game system that delivers results

**K6:**
- Funny: 4
- Intimidating: 2
- Memorable: 3
- Fair: 6

**K7:** (b) Somewhat — nice to have but not essential. More reactive dialogue would only matter to me if it conveyed mechanical information I couldn't derive from the numbers. Otherwise it's presentation, not depth.

**K8:** Flat, slightly robotic, with occasional dry inflection. Like a smart speaker that has developed opinions. Not a human voice.

**K9:** (c) Skimmed — focused on the numbers

**K10:** "Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent."

## Part 4: Scaled Assessment

### Engagement
- **S1:** 4 — I'd play a few more puzzles to confirm my system model, but not because I expect to be surprised.
- **S2:** 7 — Absolutely. I was calculating alternative lines between every puzzle.
- **S3:** 5 — Three puzzles is fine for a session. The issue isn't session length, it's strategic depth per puzzle.

### Learning & Progression
- **S4:** 4 — Different cards and tag axes, but the core decision structure was identical: refute T1, corroborate, manage repetition/contradiction.
- **S5:** 7 — The refute-first pattern transferred directly.
- **S6:** 6 — I improved, but the improvement ceiling was reached quickly.
- **S7:** 4 — The progression is flat. Puzzle 2 was easier than Puzzle 1. Puzzle 3 was comparable to Puzzle 2.

### Clarity
- **S8:** N/A (never lost)
- **S9:** 6 — The scrutiny breakdown is excellent. Mid-turn feedback (damage, scrutiny) is adequate.
- **S10:** 1 — Never confused.

### Frustration
- **S11:** 1 — Everything felt within my control.
- **S12:** 7 — The Puzzle 3 THOROUGH instead of FLAWLESS was entirely my mistake.
- **S13:** 1 — Not hard enough.
- **S14:** 5 — Trending toward too easy. I found FLAWLESS lines within one play or immediately post-game on every puzzle.

### Achievement
- **S15:** 6 — I care about FLAWLESS specifically because it represents a solved state.
- **S16:** 5 — Winning felt inevitable. FLAWLESS felt somewhat earned.
- **S17:** 7 — The scrutiny breakdown is the most valuable feedback mechanism in the game. It turns a black-box outcome into a legible system. This is what makes me want to replay.

### Net Promoter Score
- **S19:** 6 — I would recommend it to players who enjoy optimization puzzles, with the caveat that the current puzzle set may not sustain interest past 5-10 total plays. If the system gains more mechanical depth (more interference rules, non-binary tag axes, real sacrifice decisions), that number goes to 8.

## Part 5: Variety & Session

**V1:** (b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles. The tag axes changed (ASLEEP/AWAKE, AWAY/HOME, ACTIVE/IDLE) but the decision algorithm was the same each time: find the refuter, pair it with the contested card's tag-mate, manage repetition.

**V2:** Puzzle 1 (The Last Slice). The unavoidable ASLEEP/AWAKE contradiction makes FLAWLESS structurally unreachable (I believe), which is the only puzzle that presented a true constraint rather than a solvable optimization. It forced me to accept a nonzero scrutiny floor, which is more interesting than "find the zero-scrutiny line."

**V3:** Puzzle 2 (The Thermostat War). FLAWLESS on first try with a straightforward refute-first line. The phone_gps trap (AWAY tag) was too obvious to fall for. No hard choices.

**V4:** Easiest to hardest: 1. Thermostat War 2. Missing Remote 3. Last Slice

**V5:** Yes. Refutation recovery offsets risk on the turn it's played (doorbell/smart_lock T1 pattern). Corroboration with diverse sources gives 30% vs 20%. Repetition risk fires when you double-prove a concern type. Graduated contradictions: first = warning +1, second = block. Contested cards are ceil(power * 0.5). All identified by end of Puzzle 1, confirmed in Puzzles 2-3.

**V6:** (a) Much better — variety kept me engaged. But "much" is relative. Variety in cards is necessary but not sufficient. I need variety in the decision structure — puzzles where the optimal algorithm is fundamentally different, not just a re-parameterization.

## Part 6: Product & Market

**M1:** (a) Daily puzzle — one new puzzle per day. The multi-act format only works if acts introduce new mechanics, not just new cards.

**M2:** (c) $1-2 one-time — at current depth. With significantly more mechanical complexity, (d) $3-5.

**M3:** (a) New puzzles every day, (c) Leaderboards / competitive rankings. Leaderboards matter because they let me compare optimization lines with other players — that extends depth beyond what the puzzle itself provides.

**M4:** (a) Too short — but only because the puzzles were solvable. If each puzzle required genuine iteration, 3 would be right.

**M5:** (b) 5-10 minutes

**M6:** (a) Phone app

**M7:** (b) A few times a week — assuming new puzzles and/or leaderboards.

**M8:** (a) During Puzzle 1 — I had the full system mapped before Turn 2 of Puzzle 1.

**M9:** This reminds me most of a single-hand solitaire card puzzle like Marvel Snap deck-building at the edge case, crossed with Opus Magnum optimization. The "find the optimal line through a small hand with interaction effects" is the core loop. Also some echoes of competitive MTG sideboarding — evaluating which cards to bring in based on the matchup.

**M10:** "This game is a clean optimization puzzle that needs a higher ceiling."

**M11:** No. KOA is fine but not the draw. The system is the draw.

**M12:** The biggest design risk: every puzzle has the same skeleton. Refuter enables the contested high-power card. Corroboration pairs exist along tag axes. One concern requires a "risky" card. The player's job is to sequence these interactions to minimize scrutiny. Once you see the skeleton, new cards are just parameter changes. The game needs at least one puzzle that breaks the skeleton — where the refuter ISN'T the right T1 play, or where you MUST take a contradiction to win, or where playing all your cards is wrong. Force genuine dilemmas, not just sequencing puzzles.
