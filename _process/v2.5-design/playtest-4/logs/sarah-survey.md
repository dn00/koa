# Post-Game Survey — Sarah (Playtest 4)

## Part 1: Open-Ended First

**O1:** This was my best session yet. Three wins in a row, including a FLAWLESS! The puzzles feel different enough that I'm actually learning between them — I avoided the AWAY trap that killed me in PT3 and figured out that REFUTES cards cancel risk. KOA's dialogue is still the highlight.

**O2:** Getting FLAWLESS on Puzzle 2 (Thermostat War). I dodged the AWAY trap that specifically destroyed me last time and the scrutiny breakdown confirmed I played it smart. That felt like actual growth.

**O3:** The win screen saying the same "leftover pad thai" line on Puzzle 1 and Puzzle 3. KOA deserves unique win lines per puzzle. Also getting +3 scrutiny on Puzzle 3 Turn 2 when I didn't realize ACTIVE would conflict with something — that felt a bit unfair because I didn't understand the conflict.

**O4:** Make the result screen shareable! I got FLAWLESS and I literally wanted to screenshot it for my Instagram story but there's nothing visual to share. Give me a badge graphic or a score card image.

## Part 3: KOA

**K1:** Yes! "Your alibi is... frustratingly solid" made me grin. Also "Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent." KOA being salty about losing is hilarious.

**K2:** The same win screen line repeating ("leftover pad thai") in puzzles 1 and 3. Felt like a copy/paste. KOA should have unique quips per puzzle.

**K3:** In PT3 I lost because of an AWAY card conflict. KOA's conflict warning made me avoid phone_gps entirely in Puzzle 2. So yeah, past KOA reactions literally changed my strategy.

**K4:** KOA is like a sarcastic smart home that's annoyed it has to deal with your excuses.

**K5:** (a) A fun character I enjoyed interacting with

**K6:**
- Funny: 5
- Intimidating: 3
- Memorable: 5
- Fair: 5

**K7:** (a) Yes, significantly — that would make it feel alive

**K8:** Dry, slightly robotic but with personality. Think a British AI assistant who's judging you. Not quite HAL 9000 but in that zip code. Medium pitch, calm, slightly amused.

**K9:** (b) Read most of it

**K10:** "Your alibi is... frustratingly solid." That pause before "frustratingly" is chef's kiss.

## Part 4: Scaled Assessment

### Engagement
**S1:** 6 — I'd play more right now if there were more puzzles.
**S2:** 5 — I was definitely thinking about what went wrong between rounds.
**S3:** 6 — Three felt right. Could do 4-5 but 3 is a good daily amount.

### Learning & Progression
**S4:** 6 — Thermostat War felt meaningfully different. New tags, new trap, lower resistance.
**S5:** 6 — My REFUTES strategy carried across all 3 puzzles.
**S6:** 7 — THOROUGH to FLAWLESS to THOROUGH. I was clearly improving.
**S7:** 5 — Puzzle 1 was actually the hardest (resistance 17) which felt backwards? But maybe that's fine for the intro.

### Clarity
**S8:** 6 — The scrutiny breakdown made it crystal clear.
**S9:** 6 — KOA's turn reactions told me what went right or wrong.
**S10:** 2 — Mostly clear. The ACTIVE vs IDLE conflict in Puzzle 3 surprised me.

### Frustration
**S11:** 2 — The conflicts feel like fair puzzles, not cheap shots.
**S12:** 6 — When I got +3 scrutiny in Puzzle 3 I knew I'd been sloppy.
**S13:** 2 — Not too hard. Maybe the opposite for experienced players?
**S14:** 3 — Puzzle 2 felt almost too easy with the AWAY card as obvious avoid.
**S15:** 7 — I NEED FLAWLESS on all three. I care SO much.
**S16:** 6 — Wins felt earned, especially the FLAWLESS.
**S17:** 7 — The scrutiny breakdown is the best new feature. I learned more from it than from KOA's dialogue.

### Net Promoter Score
**S19:** 8 — I'd tell my Wordle friends about it. It scratches a similar itch but with more personality.

## Part 5: Variety & Session

**V1:** (b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles

**V2:** Puzzle 2 (Thermostat War) — it's where I got FLAWLESS and the scenario was the funniest. Someone cranked the heat to 84?? The Energy Saver mode being the culprit was a great twist.

**V3:** Puzzle 3 (Missing Remote) — only because I messed up Turn 2 and the ACTIVE/IDLE conflict wasn't obvious to me. Also the repeated win line from KOA.

**V4:** Easiest to hardest: 1. Thermostat War  2. Missing Remote  3. Last Slice

**V5:** I noticed: REFUTES cards cancel risk (used in all 3), corroboration bonuses for matching tags, repeated-proof penalty for proving the same concern twice, tag conflicts (ASLEEP vs AWAKE, ACTIVE vs IDLE). The AWAY trap in Puzzle 2 was obvious to me because I learned from PT3.

**V6:** (a) Much better — variety kept me engaged

## Part 6: Product & Market

**M1:** (c) Both — daily puzzle for the streak, connected cases for binge sessions

**M2:** (c) $1-2 one-time

**M3:** (a) New puzzles every day, (c) Leaderboards / competitive rankings, (e) Cosmetic badges / profile customization

**M4:** (b) Just right

**M5:** (b) 5-10 minutes

**M6:** (a) Phone app

**M7:** (a) Every day

**M8:** (a) During Puzzle 1 — though I'd been playing since PT2 so it clicked faster this time

**M9:** Wordle meets Phoenix Wright. The daily puzzle structure is Wordle, the character/evidence vibe is Phoenix Wright, but way faster.

**M10:** "This game is Wordle for people who watch true crime."

**M11:** Yes — KOA is the personality that makes it more than just a card puzzle.

**M12:** The win screen KOA line repeating across puzzles (pad thai line showed up in Puzzle 1 and Puzzle 3). Also, I still don't fully understand when ACTIVE conflicts with IDLE — the briefing says ASLEEP vs AWAKE and HOME vs AWAY but doesn't mention ACTIVE vs IDLE. Maybe that should be clearer in the card UI? Like a little "conflicts with: X" label.
