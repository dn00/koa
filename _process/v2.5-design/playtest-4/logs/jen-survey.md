# Post-Game Survey — Playtest 4 — Jen

---

## Part 1: Open-Ended First

**O1:** Describe your experience in 2-3 sentences. What stood out?

It's fun! The scenarios are cute and relatable — who hasn't been accused of eating the last slice at 2am lol. KOA has personality which makes it not just a math puzzle. I keep getting THOROUGH badge though and I feel like there's something better I'm missing.

**O2:** What was the single best moment across all 3 puzzles?

KOA saying "That's... annoyingly consistent" when I paired two sleep cards in puzzle 1. Also "I'm watching you. And the leftover pad thai" the first time was funny.

**O3:** What was the single worst moment across all 3 puzzles?

Getting hit with "repeated-proof" scrutiny in puzzles 2 and 3 when I didn't even realize I was repeating myself. Like I played motion sensor for ALERTNESS reasons but it apparently re-proved LOCATION? That felt unfair.

**O4:** If you could change one thing about this game, what would it be?

Make it more clear when a card is going to repeat a proof you already covered. Like highlight it or something. I was picking cards for the concern they address but getting punished for the proof overlap.

## Part 3: KOA (the investigator)

**K1:** Did KOA make you laugh or smile at any point? If yes, what did KOA say?

Yeah, "That's... annoyingly consistent" was great. And the first time KOA said the pad thai line I laughed. "Innocent people don't need to say it twice" was savage too.

**K2:** Did KOA ever annoy you? If yes, what triggered it?

The pad thai line repeated every single game. By puzzle 3 I was like okay we get it. Also "Present your evidence. Convince me." felt kinda generic as an opener every time.

**K3:** Did KOA's words ever change what you did next? Describe the moment.

In puzzle 2 when KOA called my story "rehearsed" I made a mental note to avoid repeating proofs in puzzle 3. Didn't fully succeed but I tried.

**K4:** How would you describe KOA's personality to a friend?

"It's like a sarcastic smart home AI that's lowkey judging you for eating pizza at 2am."

**K5:** Which of these best describes KOA?
- (a) A fun character I enjoyed interacting with

**K6:** Rate KOA on these dimensions (1-7 scale):
- Funny: 5
- Intimidating: 3
- Memorable: 5
- Fair: 4

**K7:** Would KOA being more reactive make the game better?
- (a) Yes, significantly — that would make it feel alive

**K8:** If KOA had a voice, what would it sound like?

Dry monotone with subtle sass. Like if Alexa was passive-aggressive. Maybe slightly robotic but with personality.

**K9:** Did you read all of KOA's dialogue, or did you skip/skim it?
- (b) Read most of it

**K10:** What's the most memorable thing KOA said across all 3 puzzles?

"Innocent people don't need to say it twice." That one hit different.

## Part 4: Scaled Assessment

### Engagement
**S1:** 5 — I'd play more puzzles but I'm not like dying to
**S2:** 3 — I vaguely thought about it between puzzles but didn't strategize hard
**S3:** 5 — 3 puzzles felt about right, maybe slightly short

### Learning & Progression
**S4:** 5 — Different scenarios and cards but the core loop is the same
**S5:** 5 — Yeah I knew to match tags from puzzle 1
**S6:** 4 — I feel like I'm decent but keep making the same repeated-proof mistake
**S7:** 5 — Felt natural enough

### Clarity
**S8:** 5 — The scrutiny breakdown helps but I didn't fully get repeated-proof at first
**S9:** 5 — KOA's reactions are useful
**S10:** 2 — I mostly knew what to do by now

### Frustration
**S11:** 3 — The repeated-proof thing felt a bit outside my control since I was picking for concerns not proofs
**S12:** 5 — Yeah my mistakes were mostly mine
**S13:** 2 — Not too hard
**S14:** 3 — Not too easy either, the scrutiny limit keeps it interesting

### Achievement
**S15:** 4 — I kinda want FLAWLESS but not enough to replay
**S16:** 5 — Winning felt good
**S17:** 5 — The breakdown is helpful, I actually looked at it this time

### Net Promoter Score
**S19:** 7 — I'd mention it to friends if it came up but I wouldn't like text them about it unprompted

## Part 5: Variety & Session

**V1:** (b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles

**V2:** Puzzle 1 (The Last Slice) — the pizza scenario is the funniest and most relatable. Also the "Hey Google how long does pizza stay good" card killed me.

**V3:** Puzzle 3 (The Missing Remote) — felt the most generic. A missing remote just isn't as dramatic as stolen pizza or a thermostat war.

**V4:** Rank easiest to hardest: 1. Puzzle 2 (Thermostat War) 2. Puzzle 3 (Missing Remote) 3. Puzzle 1 (Last Slice)

**V5:** I noticed the REFUTES thing cancels out risk which is cool. Contested cards get half credit. Corroboration from matching tags. And conflicts from opposing tags. I didn't notice anything super new in puzzle 3 compared to the others though.

**V6:** (a) Much better — variety kept me engaged

## Part 6: Product & Market

**M1:** (a) Daily puzzle — one new puzzle per day

**M2:** (a) No, free only — or maybe (b) free with ads. I'm not paying for a puzzle game sorry

**M3:** (a) New puzzles every day, (d) Unlockable KOA personalities or voice packs

**M4:** (b) Just right

**M5:** (b) 5-10 minutes

**M6:** (a) Phone app

**M7:** (b) A few times a week

**M8:** (a) During Puzzle 1 — but I already kinda knew from previous playtests

**M9:** It reminds me of Wordle mixed with Phoenix Wright? Like Wordle because it's a daily puzzle thing with a clean mechanic, and Phoenix Wright because you're presenting evidence to someone.

**M10:** "This game is a sassy smart home detective puzzle."

**M11:** Yes — KOA has personality, I'd mention the character

**M12:** The win quote ("I'm watching you. And the leftover pad thai.") is the same for every puzzle which breaks immersion. Like why is KOA talking about pad thai in the missing remote puzzle? Also "repeated-proof" penalty feels like it needs better signaling — I know which concern a card addresses but not which proof it overlaps with.
