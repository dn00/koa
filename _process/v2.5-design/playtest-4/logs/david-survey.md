# Post-Game Survey — David (Playtest 4)

---

## Part 1: Open-Ended First

**O1:** Describe your experience in 2-3 sentences. What stood out?

The game has matured since my last session. The scrutiny breakdown is the single biggest improvement — I can now trace exactly what went right or wrong. Three puzzles felt like a real session, not a demo. The system rewards careful reading and punishes lazy play, which is exactly what I want from a puzzle game.

**O2:** What was the single best moment across all 3 puzzles?

Getting FLAWLESS on Puzzle 2 — The Thermostat War. That was the puzzle that killed me in my last playtest. Coming back with knowledge of the AWAY trap, planning around it, and getting the best badge felt genuinely earned. That's a learning loop that most mobile games don't bother building.

**O3:** What was the single worst moment across all 3 puzzles?

The doorbell_cam + tv_log rejection in Puzzle 3. Both were IDLE tag, both zero risk. KOA said it "directly contradicts" but I couldn't figure out what contradicted what. The block mechanic itself is fine — I appreciate that it didn't consume my turn — but the error message was opaque. I need to know WHY.

**O4:** If you could change one thing about this game, what would it be?

When a card pair is blocked, tell me specifically which tag or rule triggered the rejection. "Directly contradicts" is not enough. Show me: "IDLE + IDLE from different sources conflicts with your HOME evidence" or whatever the actual reason is. The scrutiny breakdown after the game is great — bring that same transparency to mid-game blocks.

## Part 2: Puzzle-by-Puzzle Reactions

### Puzzle 1 — The Last Slice
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Played safe HOME+HOME opener, broke resistance with ASLEEP corroboration, took a calculated hit on the AWAKE speaker card for INTENT — exactly as planned.

### Puzzle 2 — The Thermostat War
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: FLAWLESS
- Scrutiny: 2/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Deliberately avoided the phone_gps AWAY trap that killed me in PT3, paired smart_lock's REFUTE with router, and finished with zero-risk motion_sensor.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 1? Yes — the scrutiny breakdown made me curious whether I could do better.

### Puzzle 3 — The Missing Remote
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Strong opener with smart_lock+wifi_log corroboration, but got surprised by the doorbell_cam+tv_log block — had to recover with motion_sensor which added repeated-proof penalty.
- **Between puzzles:** Did you want to keep playing after Puzzle 2? Yes — I had FLAWLESS and wanted to see if I could maintain it.

## Part 3: KOA (the investigator)

**K1:** Did KOA make you laugh or smile at any point? If yes, what did KOA say?

"And the leftover pad thai." That landed. Also "Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent." — KOA being grudgingly impressed is a nice touch.

**K2:** Did KOA ever annoy you? If yes, what triggered it?

"That directly contradicts what you already showed me. Rejected." — because it didn't tell me what the contradiction actually was. That's not KOA being a character, that's the system being opaque.

**K3:** Did KOA's words ever change what you did next? Describe the moment.

After the block in Puzzle 3, KOA's rejection forced me to reconsider my assumptions about IDLE cards. I switched to motion_sensor. The game changed my play through failure feedback, which is what good puzzle games do.

**K4:** How would you describe KOA's personality to a friend?

A dry, slightly passive-aggressive smart home AI that's both the judge and the opponent — like if GLaDOS ran your thermostat.

**K5:** Which of these best describes KOA?
(a) A fun character I enjoyed interacting with

**K6:** Rate KOA on these dimensions (1-7 scale):
- Funny: 5
- Intimidating: 3
- Memorable: 5
- Fair: 5

**K7:** Would KOA being more reactive make the game better?
(a) Yes, significantly — that would make it feel alive

**K8:** If KOA had a voice, what would it sound like?

Flat, measured cadence — like a smart speaker that's slightly too intelligent. Think the dry delivery of a British butler who's seen everything. Not robotic, but deliberately understated.

**K9:** Did you read all of KOA's dialogue, or did you skip/skim it?
(a) Read every word

**K10:** What's the most memorable thing KOA said across all 3 puzzles?

"Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent." — It acknowledged my strategy without complimenting it. That's good adversarial design.

## Part 5: Variety & Session

**V1:** Did the 3 puzzles feel like 3 different experiences?
(b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles

**V2:** Which puzzle was your favorite and why?

Puzzle 2 (Thermostat War). It was personal — I'd lost to it before and came back with a plan. Avoiding the AWAY trap and getting FLAWLESS felt like solving a Zelda puzzle where you finally see the pattern. The REFUTE mechanic on smart_lock neutralizing the counter on router was especially satisfying.

**V3:** Which puzzle was your least favorite and why?

Puzzle 3 (Missing Remote). Not because it was bad — the opener was great. But the doorbell_cam+tv_log block felt arbitrary. I couldn't figure out why two zero-risk IDLE cards were rejected. When the game punishes you and you don't understand why, it shifts from "puzzle" to "guessing game."

**V4:** Rank the 3 puzzles from easiest to hardest:
1. Puzzle 2 (Thermostat War — knew the trap from PT3)
2. Puzzle 1 (Last Slice — straightforward once you see the tag map)
3. Puzzle 3 (Missing Remote — the block added unexpected friction)

**V5:** Did you notice different puzzle mechanics?

Yes. Corroboration bonuses for matching tags (HOME+HOME). REFUTE cards that neutralize counters. CONTESTED cards that get half credit. Repeated-proof penalties for addressing the same concern twice. Tag conflicts (AWAKE vs ASLEEP). And the block mechanic on contradicting pairs. The system is deeper than it looks — which is exactly what I said last time.

**V6:** How did the 3-puzzle session compare to replaying the same puzzle?
(a) Much better — variety kept me engaged

## Part 6: Product & Market

**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
(c) Both — daily puzzles for the commute, multi-act stories for weekends

**M2:** Would you pay for this game?
(d) $3-5 one-time

**M3:** What would make you pay a monthly subscription?
(a) New puzzles every day
(b) Longer story cases (multi-act investigations)

**M4:** How did the 3-puzzle session feel in terms of length?
(b) Just right

**M5:** How long did the full session feel?
(b) 5-10 minutes

**M6:** Where would you play this?
(a) Phone app

**M7:** How often would you want to play this?
(b) A few times a week

**M8:** When did the game "click" for you?
(a) During Puzzle 1 — though honestly it clicked in earlier playtests. By this session I was already optimizing.

**M9:** What game or experience does this remind you of most?

A mashup of Wordle's "daily solve" format with Phoenix Wright's evidence-presentation mechanic, but distilled into something you can play in 3 minutes. The risk/reward evaluation reminds me of Slay the Spire card decisions.

**M10:** Complete this sentence: "This game is ___."

"A puzzle game that respects your intelligence."

**M11:** Would you tell a friend about KOA specifically?

Yes — but I'd describe the game system first, then mention that the AI investigator has personality. KOA is the cherry, not the sundae.

**M12:** Is there anything broken, unfair, or confusing we haven't asked about?

Two things:

1. The doorbell_cam+tv_log block in Puzzle 3 needs better feedback. This is the same opacity issue I flagged in PT3. The scrutiny breakdown is the right model — bring that transparency to ALL failure states, not just the post-game summary.

2. Badge criteria are still invisible. I got THOROUGH twice and FLAWLESS once. I can infer that FLAWLESS means low scrutiny, but what's the threshold? What other badges exist? I don't need the formula, but a hint would help. Something like "FLAWLESS: finish with scrutiny under X" or a badge gallery showing what's possible. Give players something to aim for.

Overall: this is the third time I've played and I'm still finding new mechanics. That's the mark of a system with real depth. For the right audience — people who miss figuring things out but don't have 40 hours — this could be something special. My NPS is still 8 because the clarity issues hold it back from a 9.
