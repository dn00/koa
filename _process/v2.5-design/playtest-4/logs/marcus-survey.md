# Post-Game Survey — Playtest 4 — Marcus (Session 3)

---

## Part 1: Open-Ended First

**O1:** The three-puzzle session showcased tight, elegant constraint design where every card matters and the tag system creates meaningful tradeoffs. The new scrutiny breakdown is exactly the transparency I asked for — I can now reverse-engineer the scoring and plan around it. What stood out most is that each puzzle forced at least one unavoidable contradiction, which feels intentional and well-calibrated.

**O2:** Turn 1 of Puzzle 2 — playing smart_lock + hallway_cam for HOME corroboration, watching the counter get refuted, and getting +0 scrutiny on a 2-card play. That moment of "I sequenced this perfectly" is the core appeal of this game.

**O3:** Puzzle 3, Turn 3 — playing doorbell_cam and getting hit with both repeated-proof AND conflict penalties. I suspected the conflict was unavoidable, but the repeated-proof felt like a trap I could have avoided if I'd played tv_log instead (which proves INTENT, not a required concern, so maybe no repeat penalty). The fact that I'm unsure whether that would have worked is a clarity issue.

**O4:** Show me the rules for repeated-proof penalties and tag conflicts in advance. I can model the system now after 3 sessions, but new players shouldn't need to reverse-engineer it from the scrutiny breakdown. A one-page "mechanics reference" card would make this game dramatically more accessible without reducing depth.

## Part 2: Puzzle-by-Puzzle Reactions

### Puzzle 1
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Paired ASLEEP cards for corroboration, used HOME corroboration for the midgame, then accepted the AWAKE conflict on speaker because INTENT coverage forced it.

### Puzzle 2
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: THOROUGH
- Scrutiny: 3/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Avoided the AWAY trap (phone_gps), corroborated HOME cards, refuted the counter to free router, but got hit with repeated-proof on Turn 3 because LOCATION was already addressed.
- **Between puzzles:** Yes — the scrutiny breakdown from Puzzle 1 made me immediately want to optimize my next attempt.

### Puzzle 3
- Outcome: WIN
- Badge: CLEAN
- Scrutiny: 4/5
- Concerns addressed: 3/3
- One sentence: Tight margins forced me to play an IDLE card against prior ACTIVE, and the repeated-proof on doorbell_cam's IDENTITY cost me THOROUGH — the puzzle has a scrutiny floor that prevents FLAWLESS.
- **Between puzzles:** Yes — Puzzle 2 introduced the counter-refutation interaction which I wanted to test further.

## Part 3: KOA (the investigator)

**K1:** Yes. "You got through. But I'm watching you. And the leftover pad thai." — landed perfectly as a closer. The tonal shift from serious investigator to domestic absurdity is the right register for this game.

**K2:** Not really annoyed, but KOA's "Noted. Continue." on neutral turns feels like a missed opportunity. When I make a clean play, I want KOA to react to the quality of my evidence, not just acknowledge receipt.

**K3:** Not directly. KOA's dialogue is reactive but not strategic — it tells me what happened, not what I should reconsider. That said, "That doesn't quite line up" on the conflict turn in Puzzle 1 confirmed my hypothesis about the contradiction mechanic, which informed my Puzzle 2 strategy.

**K4:** KOA is a dry, slightly exasperated smart-home AI who takes domestic disputes way too seriously — think GLaDOS doing neighborhood watch.

**K5:** (b) A neutral game system that delivers results — with occasional flashes of (a).

**K6:**
- Funny: 4
- Intimidating: 2
- Memorable: 4
- Fair: 6

**K7:** (a) Yes, significantly — that would make it feel alive. KOA naming the specific cards I played and explaining WHY they conflict would be much more instructive than generic "doesn't match" lines.

**K8:** Calm, slightly nasal, mid-Atlantic accent. Think a bored Jarvis. Measured cadence with occasional dry emphasis. Not robotic — more like a very patient bureaucrat who has seen it all.

**K9:** (a) Read every word — I'm tracking KOA's reactions for system information.

**K10:** "Two different devices agreeing? That's... annoyingly consistent." — This is KOA acknowledging my strategy, which is the most engaging version of the character.

## Part 4: Scaled Assessment

### Engagement
**S1:** 6 — I want to replay Puzzle 3 to test the tv_log theory.
**S2:** 7 — Between every puzzle I was mapping tag interactions and planning openers.
**S3:** 5 — Three puzzles felt like a solid session but I could have done 4-5 without fatigue.

### Learning & Progression
**S4:** 6 — Puzzle 2 introduced the counter-refutation cross-card interaction, which was genuinely new.
**S5:** 7 — Tag conflict awareness from Puzzle 1 directly informed my Puzzle 2 and 3 strategies.
**S6:** 5 — My badge went THOROUGH, THOROUGH, CLEAN — I got worse, not better. But my understanding deepened.
**S7:** 5 — Puzzle 3 was hardest (tightest margins, forced conflict + repeat) but Puzzle 2 was easiest (lowest resistance). The difficulty curve dipped then spiked.

### Clarity
**S8:** N/A — I never lost.
**S9:** 6 — The scrutiny breakdown post-game is excellent. In-turn feedback is adequate but could be more specific.
**S10:** 2 — I understood the mechanics well by this session, though first-time players would likely score 5+.

### Frustration
**S11:** 3 — The forced contradiction in Puzzle 3 felt borderline — I accept it as a design constraint but it's close to "unfair."
**S12:** 6 — The Puzzle 3 repeated-proof on doorbell_cam was my sequencing choice; I could have played tv_log instead.
**S13:** 2 — Difficulty is well-tuned for someone who understands the system.
**S14:** 2 — I never achieved FLAWLESS, so there's clearly room to improve.

### Achievement
**S15:** 7 — The badge tiers are my primary motivation. I want FLAWLESS.
**S16:** 6 — Winning felt earned. The THOROUGH/CLEAN distinction makes winning itself feel like a floor, not a ceiling.
**S17:** 7 — The scrutiny breakdown is the single best addition since I started playtesting. It transforms scrutiny from a black box into a legible system.

### Net Promoter Score
**S19:** 7 — I would recommend this to my board game group as "a clever 5-minute puzzle with surprising depth," but the lack of documented rules would make me hesitate to hand it to someone cold.

## Part 5: Variety & Session

**V1:** (b) Somewhat different — same core loop but new wrinkles. Each puzzle introduced a different tag-conflict axis (ASLEEP/AWAKE, HOME/AWAY, ACTIVE/IDLE) and different card interaction patterns. The core loop of "pick cards, manage scrutiny, cover concerns" was the same.

**V2:** Puzzle 2 (The Thermostat War) — the counter-refutation mechanic created a sequencing puzzle within the puzzle. Playing smart_lock first to neutralize the counter before playing router was a satisfying "aha" moment that rewarded careful reading.

**V3:** Puzzle 3 (The Missing Remote) — the tightest margins meant the least room for creative play. I was forced into a specific card order with minimal viable alternatives. The puzzle felt more like execution than strategy.

**V4:** Rank easiest to hardest: 1. Thermostat War  2. Last Slice  3. Missing Remote

**V5:** Yes, all three. Corroboration (same-tag pairing for bonus damage) was the primary positive mechanic. Tag conflicts (opposing tags across turns = scrutiny penalty) were the primary negative mechanic. Counters/CONTESTED cards halve power unless refuted by a REFUTES card. Repeated-proof adds scrutiny when you prove an already-addressed concern. I also noticed the refuted(-1) scrutiny offset on counter-refutation plays.

**V6:** (a) Much better — variety kept me engaged. Each puzzle presented a distinct optimization problem.

## Part 6: Product & Market

**M1:** (c) Both — daily puzzle for the quick hit, multi-act story for deeper investment.

**M2:** (d) $3-5 one-time — the puzzle design quality warrants a premium price point. The system has the elegance of a well-designed board game.

**M3:** (a) New puzzles every day, (b) Longer story cases

**M4:** (a) Too short — I wanted at least one more puzzle.

**M5:** (b) 5-10 minutes

**M6:** (a) Phone app — this is a commute/waiting room game.

**M7:** (b) A few times a week — daily might cause fatigue, but the system has enough depth for repeated engagement.

**M8:** (a) During Puzzle 1 — but this is my 3rd playtest session. A true new player would likely be (c) During Puzzle 2.

**M9:** Slay the Spire meets Wordle. The card-based optimization with a daily constraint format. The tag system feels like relics/synergies in StS — simple individual effects that create complex interactions when combined.

**M10:** "This game is a deceptively deep 5-minute logic puzzle."

**M11:** No — KOA is charming but not the selling point. The tag interaction system is what I'd describe to friends.

**M12:** One thing: the game says "proves: LIVENESS" and "proves: ALERTNESS" for some cards, but these are not listed as required concerns. It's unclear whether playing these cards is ever necessary or if they're purely for damage. If they're red herrings, that's fine design — but the UI should distinguish required-concern proofs from optional proofs more clearly. Maybe gray out non-required proof types. Also, I still don't know the exact formulas for corroboration bonuses or whether different sources (as opposed to same-tag) yield bigger bonuses. The scrutiny breakdown shows inputs but not corroboration math. Consider adding a damage breakdown too.
