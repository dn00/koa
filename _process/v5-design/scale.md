For a **daily puzzle with a “home AI” theme**, the best fit is a **3-hearing incident triage** format: you’re not “solving a mystery,” you’re **earning an override** from KoA by presenting *just enough* credible diagnostics under scrutiny.

In **V5 micro‑daily** (the current baseline), this concretely means:

- 6 evidence cards in hand (4 truths, 2 lies)  
- 3 hearings (turns), 1 card per hearing  
- Type Tax (repeat evidence type = −2 next turn)  
- A KOA Flag / System Check on your last card after Hearing 2

This doc describes how that baseline can scale up over time (e.g., more cards, Scrutiny/Tempo, tactics, deckbuilder mode) **without rewriting the core loop**.

### Best-fit daily chassis

**6–8 evidence cards, 3 turns, 1 evidence per turn (+ optional tactic)**

* **Turn = “Hearing”** (KoA is the gatekeeper of an override / insurance claim / security unlock)
* You present **one diagnostic artifact** per hearing:

  * sensor snapshot, event log, camera metadata, router log, device health, neighbor report, etc.
* Optional: play **one tactic** (Probe / Reframe / Quarantine / Rollback / Chain-of-custody) before presenting evidence.

This format is Wordle-length, readable, and avoids pair-combinatorics while still letting you build an alibi/narrative through **cumulative stitched narration** (“First the lock log, then the motion sensor, then the router silence…”).

## Why this theme works insanely well

Home AI gives you **native axes** that map cleanly to “deduction without typing”:

### The 4 axis families KoA can scrutinize

1. **Timeline integrity** (event ordering, gaps, drift)
2. **Sensor coherence** (do devices agree? contradictions?)
3. **Channel reliance** (you keep leaning on one subsystem: cameras/logs/apps)
4. **Operational plausibility** (does this look staged / rehearsed / automated?)

That’s perfect for **slot-based tag-driven banter**:

* “Timeline’s clean… too clean.”
* “Everything you have is app logs. No physical corroboration.”
* “These timestamps don’t align across subsystems.”

These are *decision aids* without being “pick card X.”

## How to keep it a *puzzle* (not a risk-management autopilot)

In V5 micro‑daily, the only live meter is **Belief**, plus Type Tax and the KOA Flag decision. For extended modes (beyond V5), you can optionally introduce **Scrutiny + Tempo** instead of visible “risk pips = bad card.”

* **Belief (progress)**: how close you are to override approval.
* **Scrutiny (danger)**: how aggressive KoA becomes next turn.
* Each day has a **tempo expectation**: if you present weak/low-impact evidence, KoA escalates (“You’re stalling.”)

So the real T1 decision becomes:

* **Push belief early** (but raise scrutiny and invite counters)
  vs
* **Play safe and gather signal** (but risk tempo penalties)

That’s a very “home AI” feeling: compliance, safety, escalation protocols.

---

## The daily content format that won’t require “case files”

At the top of the daily, show only:

* **Scenario (2 lines)**
* **Goal (1 line)**: “Earn override.”
* **3 Known Facts (bullets)**: “Power flickered at 10:41. Door opened once. Router rebooted.”
* **KoA stance of the day (1 line)**: “Today I’m skeptical of *single-channel stories*.”

No dossier reading needed.

---

## What the “wow” feels like (without pairs)

You get wow from:

* **cumulative stitched statements** (you sound like a competent operator)
* **KoA escalation arc** (neutral → skeptical → KOA Flag / System Check → verdict)
* **one cinematic beat**: the KOA Flag after Turn 2 (“Keep this on record or roll it back?”)

That’s the compliance-gate payoff, and it fits home AI perfectly (“I’m authorizing a risky override—convince me your story holds up to my logs.”).

---

### If you want one sentence

**Daily Home AI puzzle should feel like incident response: present three artifacts, survive scrutiny, and earn an override—KoA is the compliance gate.**

If you want, I’ll give you a concrete **V5 Daily Template** (fields + constraints) for the generator: scenario, known facts, 8 evidence cards with axis tags, KoA stance, 6-slot bark library tags, and the minimal scoring/scrutiny rules.

Yes — that **Home AI daily “incident triage” loop** is an excellent seed that can grow into a full deckbuilder later, *without* rewriting the core.

The trick is to keep a strict separation:

* **Evidence cards** = the daily case pool (generated per incident; not your deck)
* **Tactic cards** = *your* deck (persistent, collectible, synergistic)

That separation is what gives you Balatro-like scalability.

---

## How it extends cleanly

### Phase 1: Daily puzzle (no deckbuilding required)

* 3 hearings
* play **1 evidence/turn**
* optional: choose **1 tactic** from a fixed set (or none)

### Phase 2: “Loadout” (soft deckbuilding)

* Player selects **5 tactics** to bring (a “toolbelt”)
* Each hearing offers 2 tactics, pick 1 to play
* This adds build identity with minimal complexity

### Phase 3: True deckbuilder / roguelite runs

Now you introduce the classic deckbuilder progression **inside a run**:

* hearings become “rooms”
* KoA stances become “blinds/bosses”
* after each hearing you:

  * draft a new tactic
  * upgrade a tactic
  * remove a weak tactic
  * gain a relic/perk that changes scoring/scrutiny

Daily still exists; the full game is “Case Run” mode.

## The core mechanics that scale into deckbuilding

Your daily already has the right hooks:

### 1) Two currencies → perfect for tactics synergies

* **Belief (progress)** and **Scrutiny (danger)** is the deckbuilder engine.
  Tactics can:
* increase belief
* reduce scrutiny
* convert scrutiny into belief
* “bank” belief for later
* manipulate KoA counters

### 2) KoA as the opponent model

KoA stances and objections naturally become:

* **enemy passives**
* **boss mechanics**
* **countercards**
  This is exactly what deckbuilders need: predictable but punishing patterns.

### 3) Axis-based playstyles (build archetypes)

Your “axes” become archetypes:

* **Timeline build**: chain-of-custody, timestamp normalization, drift correction
* **Coherence build**: cross-sensor corroboration, contradiction traps
* **Channel-diversity build**: avoids type echo penalties, rewards coverage
* **Aggro build**: high belief spikes, survives scrutiny via shields

That’s the “meta” players pay for.

---

## What changes later (and what must not)

**Do change later:**

* number of hearings per run (3 → 8–12)
* drafting/upgrading/removal
* relics/perks
* multiple KoA boss stances

**Do NOT change:**

* the “present artifact under scrutiny” core loop
* the meaning of Belief/Scrutiny
* the 5–6 dialogue slots (just add more variants)

That’s how you avoid a rewrite.

---

## Monetization map (subscription + deckbuilder coexist)

* **Free**: daily standard case
* **Sub**: archive + personal loadouts + weekly long case + cosmetics/voice packs
* **Premium game** (optional): full roguelite deckbuilder mode

---

So yes: the daily puzzle is not a dead-end. It’s the **tutorialized micro-version** of the eventual deckbuilder, as long as you treat deckbuilding as **tactics/tooling**, not evidence itself.
