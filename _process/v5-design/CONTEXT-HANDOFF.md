## Project: Emergent Detective Simulation
A cozy, comedic detective game where players solve daily mysteries generated by a deep deterministic simulation. "Knives Out meets Animal Crossing."

---

## 📅 Current Status
**Core Simulation & Emergent Systems Complete.**
The validation stack runs, generates cases with 96% validity, and features a fully emergent gossip ecology where character relationships and motives evolve over time.

### ✅ What is Done
1. **Deterministic Simulation Engine** (`src/sim.ts`)
   - Simulates NPC routines, locations, and interactions tick-by-tick.
   - Deterministic event log generation for validatable replayability.
   - Core world model (5 rooms, 5 NPCs, 12 items).

2. **Emergent Comedy & Variety**
   - **4 Crime Types:** Theft, Sabotage, Prank, Disappearance.
   - **12 Items:** Distributed across all rooms (Kitchen, Living, Bedroom, Office, Garage).
   - **Distracted Witnesses:** Simulation handles NPCs who are present but "distracted" (sleeping, on phone), allowing for more crime opportunities.
   - **Variety Analysis:** 128+ unique combos, days-to-repeat > 64.

3. **Emergent Gossip Ecology** (`src/gossip/`)
   - **True Emergence:** Motives are no longer templates. They are derived from simulated history.
   - **Pre-Simulation:** Runs 200 ticks of background life before each case to evolve relationships.
   - **Dynamic Relationships:** Proximity and rumors shift affinities (0-100).
   - **Gossip Propagation:** Events spawn rumors that spread through the house network.
   - **History & Grudges:** Tracks past cases; wrongly accused NPCs hold grudges that drive future crimes.

### 📊 Validation Stats
- **Pass Rate:** 96.2% (Target: 90%)
- **Valid Seeds:** 42, 7 (Success with emergent motives)
- **Known Issues:** Garage/Bedroom item opportunity rate is low (~1.3%).

## 📂 Key Files
- `src/sim.ts` - Main entry point. orchestrates Pre-Sim -> Crime -> Post-Sim.
- `src/gossip/` - The emergent brain.
  - `motives.ts` - Derives "Why" from state (Grudge > Rumor > Affinity).
  - `rumors.ts` - Handles gossip spawning and spreading.
  - `history.ts` - Tracks long-term memory (grudges/alliances).
- `src/world.ts` - Static world definition (Room graph, Items, NPC schedules).
- `src/validators.ts` - Ensures cases are solvable and fair (alibi checks).

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 12)
The simulation is ready. Now we need the **Player Layer**.

1. **Player Action Executor** (`src/actions.ts`)
   - Implement `Interview`, `Search`, `CheckLog`, `CrossReference`.
   - Logic for revealing hidden info based on AP cost.

2. **Player State Manager** (`src/player.ts`)
   - Track AP (Action Points).
   - Manage "Evidence Bag" (what the player knows vs what exists).

3. **KOA Presenter** (`src/koa/`)
   - The "Voice" of the game.
   - Translate raw JSON events into cheeky AI dialogue.
   - "I saw Bob in the kitchen" -> "Bob was seen lurking near the sourdough at 7:15pm."

4. **Game Loop**
   - Tie it all together: Init -> Daily Turn -> Action -> Feedback -> Accusation.
