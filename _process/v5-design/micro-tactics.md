Not if you do them **the right way**. They become “too hard” only when tactics introduce **new mental models** (timers, stacks, counters, multi-step synergies) or when players have to learn a whole deckbuilder layer *before* they can enjoy the daily.

## When tactics are OK in a daily

Tactics are fine if they meet all of these:

* **Max 1 tactic per hearing** (optional)
* **3–5 total tactics in the entire mode** (fixed kit)
* **One-sentence effect** (“Peek 1 tag, take -2”)
* **No new sub-systems** (no energy, no cooldowns, no status effects)
* **UI previews outcome** (shows exactly what changes)

In that form, tactics feel like **Wordle’s “hard mode toggle”**: a small lever, not a second game.

## When tactics are too hard

They’ll feel heavy if:

* tactics are collectible/variable in Standard Daily (unfair + confusing)
* you draw from a large deck (players don’t know what to expect)
* tactics interact with multiple meters (scrutiny/tempo/counters) at once
* you have more than ~5 tactic text blocks to learn early

## The best compromise for Daily

### Standard Daily: fixed mini-kit (recommended)

Everyone gets the same **3 tactics**, every day, forever.

Example kit (clean, learnable):

1. **Probe** — “Reveal this evidence’s axis tag. -2 Belief.”
2. **Buffer** — “Negate the next KoA Tax.”
3. **Reframe** — “If this evidence is a lie, reduce its penalty by 2.”

That’s it. No deckbuilding in Standard. Still gives agency and prevents “blind gambling.”

### Personal Daily: loadout comes later

Deckbuilding stays optional and lives in Personal/Subscriber modes.

## My call

If you want the daily to be **sticky for normal humans**, ship:

* **No tactics** *or* **fixed 3-tactic kit**
  …and keep deckbuilding out of the daily until the core loop proves fun.

So: tactics in daily are **not too hard** if you cap them hard and keep them boringly legible.

Yes — that’s the cleanest mental model:

## Per hearing you always play **1 Evidence**

…and you may play **1 optional Support**.

That Support can be:

* a **Tactic** (recommended once tactics exist), **or**
* in earlier versions, a **Support Evidence** (if you still want “2 evidence” sometimes)

### The “final” daily structure (simple)

**Hearing =**

1. Pick **Evidence** (required)
2. Pick **Support** (optional): **Tactic** *(most common)*
3. Resolve + KoA banter

That keeps the UI consistent across versions.

---

## Rule hygiene (so it doesn’t get confusing)

* **Never allow both** “Support Evidence” *and* “Tactic” in the same daily mode at first.

  * For **Standard Daily**: Support = **Tactic only** (fixed mini-kit) or Support disabled.
  * If you want 2 evidence, make that a **special tactic** later (“Bundle Artifacts”).

This prevents “wait, do I add another log or use my move?” confusion.

---

## If you want the absolute simplest framing

Don’t say “Support.” Say:

* **Submit Evidence** (required)
* **Use a Move** (optional)

Moves = tactics. One per hearing, max.

That’s it.


---
Yes — **but only as a fixed mini-kit in Standard Daily**, not as deckbuilding/loadouts.

### What I recommend

**Standard Daily (everyone, fairness-first):**

* **1 Evidence per hearing (required)**
* **0–1 Tactic per hearing (optional)**
* Fixed **3 tactics**, always available (no draw RNG)

This solves your biggest daily problem (Turn 1 “blind gamble”) **without** turning the daily into a deckbuilder tutorial.

**Personal/Subscriber modes (later):**

* Loadout/collection tactics (deckbuilding) lives here
* Separate leaderboard

---

## Why tactics are worth it (in daily)

They add **one extra decision lever** that produces “aha” and replay:

* “Do I spend my probe now or save it for Objection risk?”
* “Do I buffer KoA’s tax or push for points?”

This makes dailies feel less coin-flippy while keeping sessions short.

---

## The non-negotiable constraints (or it becomes too hard)

To keep it daily-simple:

* **Exactly 3 tactics** in Standard
* **No resource system** (no energy, cooldowns, stacks)
* **Effects are single-sentence and previewed**
* **No synergies** (each tactic stands alone)
* **Optional, never required** to finish

---

## The 3-tactic kit I’d ship

1. **Probe** *(Signal)*
   “Reveal this evidence’s axis tag. −2 Belief.”

2. **Buffer** *(Protect)*
   “Ignore the next KoA Tax.”

3. **Reframe** *(Protect/Control)*
   “If this evidence is a lie, reduce its penalty by 2.”

That’s enough to create skill expression and replay without teaching a whole new game.

So: **yes, include tactics in daily**, but keep them **fixed and tiny** until the core loop proves sticky.
