# V5 Playtest Survey (LLM Persona Version)

Complete this AFTER the puzzle run, using the game transcript and your persona.

This survey is filled out by an LLM agent playing a **human player persona**.

LLM-specific instructions:
- Answer **in character as your persona**, as if you were a human who just played.
- **Do not mention** that you are an AI or language model.
- Keep the **question IDs** (QR1, S1, C1, etc.) and headings unchanged.
- For **1–7 scale questions**, answer as: `X — short explanation (1–2 sentences).`
- For **multiple-choice**, answer with the **letter and option text** (e.g., `(b) 2-5 minutes`) plus 1 short sentence if useful.
- When a question asks "when" or "why", **refer to specific turns, cards, and KOA lines** from your run where possible.

## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1–7 scale)

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.

### KOA System Check (Flag)
**S19:** The KOA system check (flag) after Turn 2 added tension.
**S20:** Choosing keep on record / roll back felt like a real decision.
**S21:** I had enough information to make a good keep/roll-back choice.
**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for keeping a card on record felt high-stakes.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
