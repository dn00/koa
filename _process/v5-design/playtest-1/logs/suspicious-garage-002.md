## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 - The FLAWLESS victory was satisfying, but I'm curious if harder puzzles would punish my cautious strategy.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
5 - Some tension, but once I identified the two obvious lies, the remaining choices felt safer than expected.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
5 - The 2 AM garage door mystery was intriguing enough, though I was more focused on the deduction mechanics.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
4 - I won FLAWLESS, so not much regret, but I wondered if I was too cautious early on.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
7 - The briefing was clear. Truth adds strength, lies subtract strength-1, type tax, objection stakes.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
6 - Intuitive once I saw it in action, though I had to double-check the lie penalty formula.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
7 - Very clear. I specifically avoided SENSOR back-to-back on Turn 2.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 - The +2/-4 for standing vs -2 guaranteed for withdrawing was crystal clear.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 - Every point was traceable: +3, +3, +2 (objection), +4 = 62.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
7 - The Known Facts directly contradicted two cards (garage_app and motion_garage), making lie detection straightforward.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
7 - I used logical deduction to eliminate the two lies based on factual contradictions.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
6 - Yes, though I was suspicious even of cards I deemed "safe" due to my persona.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
5 - The time attribute was crucial (2:17 AM phone activity vs "no activity after 11 PM"). Type mattered for tax. Location less so.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
7 - This was my primary method. "Motion sensor: no movement" vs "Motion was detected" was the clearest contradiction.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing).
6 - I chose neighbor_testimony as a safe moderate-strength play, though I wasn't certain which cards were lies yet.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
6 - I consciously avoided playing SENSOR after SENSOR on Turn 2.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
7 - Yes, I went TESTIMONY -> SENSOR -> DIGITAL, no repeats.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
N/A - I never took the tax because I always had a different-type option.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
5 - Fair in principle, but I think it would feel punishing if I had to take it on a suspected lie.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
5 - Some tension, but since I could see the +3 beliefChange, I knew the card was truth before deciding.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
4 - For me, the decision was obvious once I saw the truth confirmation in the beliefChange. In retrospect, hiding that would make it harder.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
7 - Too much information, actually. The beliefChange revealed the card was truth.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
6 - High-stakes on paper, but knowing the truth made it a free +2.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
5 - Fair, but the lie contradictions were quite obvious. Both lies directly contradicted Known Facts.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
7 - I earned this through logical deduction, not luck.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
5 - It was definitely reachable. I hit FLAWLESS, suggesting the target might be too lenient.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
5 - The passive-aggressive quips added personality, though KOA didn't influence my strategy.

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
5 - "Reddit at 11:30, then nothing. Your phone went quiet. Just like your explanation." was amusing.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 - Yes, the snippy commentary fit the smart home AI vibe.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
2 - Not really. I focused on the mechanics and facts, not KOA's flavor text.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
4 - I read them but didn't analyze them for clues.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
5 - Somewhat. The claim text helped, but I was more focused on strength and type.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
4 - I wanted to win, but didn't emotionally invest in proving my innocence.

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
5 - I read it but prioritized the JSON data.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
7 - 100% earned through deduction.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
5 - After securing CLEARED at the objection, I went for FLAWLESS on Turn 3.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
5 - Somewhat. The FLAWLESS threshold gave me a secondary goal.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 - Very satisfying. Confirming my deductions (garage_app and motion_garage as lies) validated my strategy.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
7 - Solid puzzle game. Would recommend to friends who like deduction games, though I'd want to see if later puzzles are harder.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney - You're presenting evidence to prove your innocence, and wrong evidence hurts your case. The objection mechanic even feels like the courtroom confrontations.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
It's much more compact. A full Ace Attorney cross-examination can take 30+ minutes. This is 3 turns and done.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth. In Ace Attorney, you uncover a complex story. Here, the scenario is static context rather than an unfolding mystery.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with daily puzzle structure and hidden trap cards."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When I compared motion_garage's claim ("no movement detected overnight") to Known Fact #3 ("Motion was detected near the garage around 2 AM"). The direct contradiction was an "aha!" moment.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes, twice:
1. Known Fact #3 (motion detected) vs motion_garage (no movement) - Clear lie
2. Known Fact #2 (no phone activity after 11 PM) vs garage_app (phone used at 2:17 AM) - Clear lie

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes, on Turn 2. I had sleep_tracker (SENSOR) and car_dashcam (SENSOR) as options, but since Turn 1 was TESTIMONY, both would have been tax-free. I chose car_dashcam over sleep_tracker based on confidence, not tax. On Turn 3, I chose browser_history (DIGITAL) partly to avoid the tax from playing another SENSOR.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Seeing FLAWLESS and the lie reveal confirming my two suspected lies were correct.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Briefly worrying about the browser_history claim ("last activity 11:30 PM") potentially contradicting "no activity after 11 PM" - I almost talked myself out of a good play.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Not really. The Known Facts gave clear guidance. Maybe Turn 1 had a small element of guessing since I hadn't confirmed anything yet.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Mrs. Patterson heard the door. Saw no one. She sees everything. Usually." - The "Usually" adds character.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
I worried that the beliefChange in the JSON revealed truth/lie status before the objection, which felt like it might undermine the intended tension. Not "tricked" but potentially a design oversight.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
As a suspicious player, I avoided the highest-strength card (motion_garage at 5) because it felt like bait. I chose neighbor_testimony (3, TESTIMONY) because testimony feels harder to fabricate than digital evidence, and strength 3 is modest enough to not be a trap.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
1. "Motion was detected near the garage around 2 AM" - This directly contradicts motion_garage's claim of "no movement detected overnight." Tagged as lie.
2. "Your phone showed no app activity after 11 PM" - This directly contradicts garage_app's claim of "manual override triggered from your phone at 2:17 AM." Tagged as lie.
3. The other facts (garage door opened, car didn't move) were consistent with the remaining cards.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
I sequenced TESTIMONY -> SENSOR -> DIGITAL to avoid any tax. Each turn used a different type.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
I saw that car_dashcam gave +3 beliefChange, meaning it was truth. Standing by truth gives +2 bonus. As a suspicious player I almost withdrew, but the confirmed truth made standing the logical choice. My persona says I might stand on "weak cards I'm confident about" - this qualified.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
I might take more risks to test whether my paranoid strategy is optimal. Playing browser_history on Turn 1 (higher strength) could have given me more cushion.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
For this puzzle, there was a correct strategy: identify the two fact-contradicting lies and avoid them. But I think harder puzzles might have subtler lies that require more interpretation.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

### Format
**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
(a) Daily puzzle - one new scenario per day. I like the bite-sized nature, and it fits my paranoid analysis style.

**M2:** If this were a daily puzzle, how many days would you play?
(d) As long as puzzles stay fresh. If the lie patterns become predictable, I'd stop.

### Session Length
**M3:** How long did the puzzle FEEL like it took?
(b) 2-5 minutes. I spent time analyzing the Known Facts and cards.

**M4:** Was that the right length?
(b) Just right. Long enough to feel like a puzzle, short enough for a daily habit.

### Audience & Channels
**A1:** Where would you MOST expect to find this game?
(b) Web browser - like Wordle.

**A2:** What device would you MOST want to play on?
(a) Phone - for daily puzzle convenience.

**A3:** If this were free, how often would you ideally play?
(c) Most days - as part of a daily puzzle routine.

### Identity
**M5:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
"You have to convince your snarky smart home AI you didn't commit a crime by choosing which evidence cards to play, but some of them are lies."

**M6:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets smart home interrogation." Does that feel accurate?
Yes, though "interrogation" might overstate KOA's role. It's more "smart home judgment."

**M7:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
Subtler lies. The contradictions were too obvious in this puzzle. Make me work harder to spot them.

### Sharing / Virality
**M8:** How likely are you to share a result or screenshot from this game with a friend? (1-7 scale)
4 - I might share a FLAWLESS result, but there's no visual hook like Wordle's colored grid.

**M9:** What would you MOST want to share?
(c) A wild lie reveal - if a lie fooled me, I'd want to share the moment.

### Pricing & Monetization

**P1:** Would you pay for this game?
(a) Yes, one-time purchase.

**P2:** If one-time purchase, what's the max you'd pay?
(b) $2.99 - $4.99 - assuming a decent library of puzzles.

**P3:** If subscription, what's the max monthly price you'd pay?
(a) $0.99/month - only if there's genuinely new content.

**P4:** What would make a subscription worth it? (pick all that apply)
(a) New puzzle every day
(c) Weekly story campaigns

**P5:** If you paid, what would you feel you're paying FOR? (pick up to 2)
(a) Daily new content
(b) Deep story / campaigns

**P6:** Compared to what you pay for similar games (Wordle NYT, puzzle apps), this feels...
(b) Worth paying about the same.

**P7:** Would you pay MORE for a "season pass" (e.g., $9.99 for 3 months of daily puzzles) instead of a monthly sub?
(b) Maybe, depends on content.

**P8:** What is the FIRST thing that would make you STOP paying?
(a) Repeated puzzles / stale content - my suspicious nature needs fresh lies to analyze.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: garage-door

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): neighbor_testimony, car_dashcam, browser_history
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (TESTIMONY -> SENSOR). T2->T3? No (SENSOR -> DIGITAL).
- Objection: stood by on car_dashcam (was truth, +2)
- Final belief / target: 62 / 57
- Tier: FLAWLESS
- Cards left unplayed: sleep_tracker, garage_app, motion_garage
- Which were lies: garage_app, motion_garage

One sentence - what did you learn?
The Known Facts are your best friend - both lies directly contradicted established facts, making deduction straightforward if you read carefully.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with varying difficulty. Some days should have obvious lies (beginner-friendly), other days should have subtle lies that require careful reading.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the lie patterns become predictable (e.g., "highest strength card is always a lie") or if the Known Facts always give away the lies this directly.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Hide the beliefChange result until after the objection decision. Knowing the card was truth (+3) before choosing stand/withdraw removes tension.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
As a suspicious player, I was rewarded for my paranoia this time - the strong cards WERE the traps. But I wonder if future puzzles should punish excessive caution to keep the strategy space interesting. Also, the type tax is a clever mechanic but felt underutilized in a 3-turn game with 4 types. Maybe 4-5 turns would make sequencing more meaningful.
