## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 — I won and my paranoid strategy was validated, so I'm curious if it would work on other puzzles.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
6 — Every card felt like a potential trap, especially the high-strength ones. The tension was real.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
5 — The 3 AM printer mystery was intriguing, though I was more focused on not getting caught in a lie than solving the mystery.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
5 — I keep wondering if I should have stood by smart_lock. My paranoia cost me FLAWLESS.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
7 — The briefing was clear: 6 cards, 3 plays, 2 lies, reach the target.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
6 — Simple enough once you see it in action.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
7 — Clear rule, and it factored into my Turn 3 decision (avoided SENSOR after SENSOR).

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 — Stand for +2/-4 gamble, withdraw for guaranteed -2. Crystal clear.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 — I played 3 truths, withdrew once costing me 2 points. Final math added up perfectly.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
6 — The email_draft claiming work at 11:30 PM contradicted my "in bed by 11 PM" alibi. That helped me avoid it.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
5 — Mostly reasoning, though my approach was "avoid high strength" which is more heuristic than deduction.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
6 — partner_testimony felt safe (matched facts, moderate strength). printer_queue felt like gambling.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
5 — Time was most useful (checking if claims fit the timeline). Type influenced my trust level (TESTIMONY > SENSOR > DIGITAL in my paranoid mind).

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
6 — The email_draft claim directly contradicted my stated bedtime. The printer_queue claim seemed to incriminate rather than exonerate me.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
6 — partner_testimony confirmed a Known Fact (I told KOA I was in bed by 11 PM) and felt like a reasoned choice.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
5 — On Turn 3, I considered motion_hallway but rejected it partly because of the -2 type tax (SENSOR after SENSOR).

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
6 — I deliberately varied types: TESTIMONY -> SENSOR -> DIGITAL.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
4 — I never actually paid the tax, so I can't say if it was "worth it." I avoided it.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
5 — It's a meaningful deterrent without being crippling. Fair design.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
7 — This was the most stressful moment. Standing by felt like walking into a trap.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
7 — It forced me to confront my confidence level. I had reasoned smart_lock was safe, but my paranoia won.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
5 — I had reasoning (card matched Known Facts) but still withdrew because the downside scared me.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
7 — The asymmetry is brutal. -4 is devastating, which is why I withdrew.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
6 — Two lies out of six, with deduction clues available. Challenging but not unfair.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
6 — I won by avoiding the high-strength traps through reasoning (and paranoia).

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
6 — I needed 57, started at 50. My cautious play (3+4+3=10, minus 2 for withdraw = +8) barely cleared it.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
6 — The passive-aggressive tone came through. "That's what partners are supposed to say" had personality.

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
5 — "No one in, no one out. The mystery thickens." was decent. The withdraw line "It was suspiciously convenient" felt pointed.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 — Yes, the snark and doubt fit the smart home AI persona.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
3 — I was more focused on my paranoid strategy than KOA's commentary.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
5 — I read the lines and appreciated the flavor, but score mattered more.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
5 — The claim text helped frame it as presenting evidence to a skeptical AI.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
4 — I wanted to win, but I didn't deeply care about the 3 AM printer mystery.

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
5 — I read KOA's responses but primarily checked wasLie and belief.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
6 — I avoided the lies through reasoning. That feels earned.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
5 — I settled for CLEARED, but knowing I could have had FLAWLESS if I'd stood by stings.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
5 — The tiers provide nice gradation, though CLEARED vs FLAWLESS wasn't foremost in my risk calculations.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 — Seeing that email_draft and printer_queue were the lies validated my entire strategy. Very satisfying.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
7 — It's clever and quick. I'd recommend it to puzzle fans.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Clue / Cluedo — Both involve deduction from evidence, trying to figure out what's true and what's not. The Known Facts work like gathered clues.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Faster pace. Clue can drag on; this is 3 turns and done. The tension is compressed into a few minutes.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less emergent gameplay. In Clue, other players' moves give you information. Here, you're alone with static facts.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Clue but with a snarky AI and a ticking clock."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When the lies were revealed as email_draft and printer_queue. I had flagged both as suspicious from the start. My paranoia was justified.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes. The Known Fact "You told KOA you were in bed by 11 PM" directly contradicted email_draft's claim of "work activity at 11:30 PM." That inconsistency made me avoid it.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Turn 3. I considered motion_hallway (SENSOR) but the -2 type tax after smart_lock (SENSOR) made it a worse option than browser_history (DIGITAL, no tax).

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
The lie reveal at the end. Seeing printer_queue (the strongest, most tempting card) confirmed as a lie felt like validation of my entire suspicious worldview.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Withdrawing on smart_lock and seeing it was actually true. I left FLAWLESS on the table because I was too scared to stand by.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Partially on Turn 3. browser_history was my least-bad option, but I wasn't certain it was true - I just trusted the timeline fit.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Withdrawing the lock data. Smart. It was suspiciously convenient." — KOA mocking my paranoia while I was actually wrong to withdraw.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The design felt fair. The lies made sense in retrospect (contradicted facts or were suspiciously strong).

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I chose partner_testimony because: (1) it was TESTIMONY type, which I trust more than DIGITAL; (2) it had moderate strength (3), which felt safer; (3) it confirmed a Known Fact (I said I was in bed by 11 PM). Low strength = low risk.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
I checked each card's claim against the facts. email_draft claimed 11:30 PM work activity, contradicting my stated 11 PM bedtime. smart_lock confirmed the door stayed locked (matching a Known Fact). partner_testimony matched my stated bedtime. printer_queue's claim seemed to incriminate me rather than exonerate me, which felt wrong.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I deliberately varied types (TESTIMONY -> SENSOR -> DIGITAL) to avoid the -2 penalty. On Turn 3, type tax pushed me away from motion_hallway toward browser_history.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
Pure risk aversion. I had reasoned smart_lock was safe (it matched Known Facts), but the -4 penalty for being wrong terrified me. -2 guaranteed felt safer than risking -4. My persona demands I take the safe loss.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
I might consider standing by when a card directly confirms a Known Fact. smart_lock was a clear match, and I should have trusted my reasoning. But my paranoid nature might make the same choice again.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Probably a mix. Avoiding high-strength cards as a suspicious player worked here, but each puzzle's Known Facts should guide specific deductions. Pure paranoia without deduction would miss good plays.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: midnight-print

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): partner_testimony, smart_lock, browser_history
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (TESTIMONY -> SENSOR). T2->T3? No (SENSOR -> DIGITAL).
- Objection: withdrew on smart_lock
- Final belief / target: 58 / 57
- Tier: CLEARED
- Cards left unplayed: motion_hallway, email_draft, printer_queue
- Which were lies: email_draft, printer_queue

One sentence — what did you learn?
My suspicious strategy of avoiding high-strength cards paid off perfectly: both lies were the strength 4 and 5 cards I refused to trust.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with varied deduction patterns. New KOA personality quirks. Maybe escalating difficulty through a week.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the lie patterns became predictable, or if the Known Facts stopped being useful for deduction.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Show the truth/lie status BEFORE the objection decision, so standing by becomes a victory lap rather than a gamble. Though that might reduce tension too much.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
The objection mechanic is the heart of the tension. As a suspicious player, I'll probably always withdraw, which means I'm leaving points on the table. That's a feature, not a bug - my paranoia has consequences. Well-designed trade-off.
