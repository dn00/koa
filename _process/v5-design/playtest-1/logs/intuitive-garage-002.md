## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 — The FLAWLESS win felt great, and I'd love to test my instincts on another scenario.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
5 — The tension was there, especially when deciding between cards that felt "safe" versus the ones giving me bad vibes.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
5 — A garage door opening at 2 AM is intriguing enough; I was curious who or what actually triggered it.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
4 — I won FLAWLESS, so not much regret, but I did wonder if `car_dashcam` would have worked just as well on T3.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
6 — The briefing was clear. Truth adds, lies subtract, type tax for repeats, objection after T2.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
5 — Made sense once I read it, though I had to remind myself lies subtract strength-1, not full strength.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
6 — Clear rule, and I deliberately avoided playing DIGITAL twice in a row.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 — Very clear: stand by a truth = +2, stand by a lie = -4, withdraw = -2 always.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 — Each turn showed the belief change, and the lie reveal at the end confirmed my gut feelings.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
7 — The Known Facts were essential. "No phone activity after 11 PM" directly contradicted `garage_app`. "Motion detected near garage" contradicted `motion_garage`.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
6 — My intuition was backed by the Known Facts, so it felt like reasoning, not random guessing.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
6 — `browser_history` felt safe because it matched Known Facts. `motion_garage` felt like gambling because it contradicted them.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
5 — The time stamps helped compare against Known Facts (2:17 AM claims vs. 11 PM cutoff).

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
7 — Absolutely. The claims were the key to spotting contradictions with Known Facts.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1–7 scale)
7 — `browser_history` matched the Known Fact about no phone activity after 11 PM perfectly.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
5 — I considered it but never triggered it since I naturally varied types (DIGITAL, TESTIMONY, SENSOR).

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
6 — Yes, I deliberately chose `neighbor_testimony` (TESTIMONY) after `browser_history` (DIGITAL).

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
4 — Didn't encounter this scenario since I never needed to eat the penalty.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
5 — It's meaningful enough to matter but not so harsh it ruins your run.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
6 — Definitely a tense moment. I had to commit to my gut feeling about `neighbor_testimony`.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
6 — The +2/-4 swing meant I had to really trust my instincts.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
6 — I felt confident because nothing in the Known Facts contradicted the neighbor's testimony.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
6 — High enough to matter. If I'd been wrong, I'd have gone from 57 to 53, losing the win.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
6 — The lies were detectable through Known Facts, but you had to pay attention.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
7 — FLAWLESS felt earned. I identified both lies correctly through gut + reasoning.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
6 — Starting at 50, needing 57, playing 3 truths with the objection bonus got me to 62.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
5 — KOA has personality. The passive-aggressive comments like "Just like your explanation" felt very smart-home-AI.

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
5 — "Mrs. Patterson's word holds. For now." was a nice passive-aggressive jab.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 — Yes, KOA's skepticism felt very "I'm watching you" rather than "court verdict."

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
4 — Not heavily. I trusted my gut more than KOA's commentary.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
5 — I noticed KOA's lines, though I didn't let them override my instincts.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
6 — Yes, it felt like building an alibi: "Here's my browser history, here's my neighbor's word."

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
5 — I wanted to know what actually opened that garage door!

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
6 — I read KOA's responses and enjoyed the flavor.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
7 — FLAWLESS after correctly identifying both lies and standing by a truth? Absolutely earned.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
6 — Once I hit 59 after the objection, I definitely pushed for 62+.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
5 — Knowing FLAWLESS existed made me consider my final card more carefully.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 — Seeing `garage_app` and `motion_garage` confirmed as lies was extremely satisfying. My gut was right!

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
8 — It's a clever little puzzle with good flavor. I'd tell friends who like deduction games.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney — You're presenting evidence to convince someone of your innocence, reading the "room" for reactions, and building a coherent narrative.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
It's much faster. Ace Attorney takes hours; this takes minutes. The micro-format is perfect for daily play.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth. Ace Attorney has twists, character development, dramatic revelations. This is a quick puzzle.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with Wordle's daily micro-puzzle format."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When I noticed `garage_app` claimed phone activity at 2:17 AM while the Known Facts said no phone activity after 11 PM. That was a clear contradiction.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes, exactly the above. Also, `motion_garage` claimed "no movement detected overnight" but the Known Facts stated "motion was detected near the garage around 2 AM." Direct contradiction.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
It influenced my T2 decision. I had already played DIGITAL, so I chose TESTIMONY (`neighbor_testimony`) to avoid the -2 tax, even though I also had good SENSOR options.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Standing by `neighbor_testimony` and seeing it confirmed as truth, earning the +2 bonus and pushing me past the target.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
None, honestly. The puzzle flowed well and my intuition held up.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Briefly on T2 when choosing between `neighbor_testimony`, `sleep_tracker`, and `car_dashcam`. All three felt okay, so I went with story coherence rather than pure deduction.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Mrs. Patterson's word holds. For now." — The passive-aggressive "For now" is perfectly KOA.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The lies were fair. They contradicted Known Facts in detectable ways.

---

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I chose `browser_history` because it directly aligned with the Known Fact "phone showed no app activity after 11 PM." It felt like the safest, most verifiable claim.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
I compared each card's claim to the Known Facts:
- `garage_app` claimed phone activity at 2:17 AM but Known Facts said no phone activity after 11 PM. Contradiction = likely lie.
- `motion_garage` claimed no motion but Known Facts said motion was detected. Contradiction = likely lie.
- The other cards didn't contradict anything, so they felt safer.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. After playing DIGITAL on T1, I chose TESTIMONY on T2 to avoid the -2 penalty. On T3, I had flexibility since TESTIMONY was my previous type.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
I asked myself: "Did this card feel right when I played it?" `neighbor_testimony` didn't contradict any Known Facts and fit the story I was building. My gut said truth, so I stood by it.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Not much. Maybe I'd consider the type sequencing more strategically from the start, but my intuitive approach worked this time.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Both. The "correct" baseline is: compare claims to Known Facts to identify contradictions. But puzzle-specific details matter, and sometimes you have to trust your gut when multiple cards feel safe.

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with variety (different rooms, different incidents, different evidence types) and KOA's personality shining through.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
Repetitive scenarios or if the lies became predictable (always the high-strength cards, always the same contradiction patterns).

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Add a brief epilogue explaining what ACTUALLY happened with the garage door. The mystery deserves closure!

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
KOA is the star. The passive-aggressive smart home AI personality is what makes this memorable. Lean into that flavor. Also, the 2-lie setup with 6 cards and 3 plays feels balanced — enough uncertainty to be tense, but enough information to reason through it. Great foundation for a daily puzzle.
