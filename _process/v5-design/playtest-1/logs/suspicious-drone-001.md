## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 - I want to try again with less paranoia. The loss felt learnable.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
6 - Every card felt like it could be a trap. The strength-5 card haunted me.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
5 - The 4 AM drone order is a fun premise. I wanted to prove my innocence.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
7 - Constantly. If I had stood at the objection, I would have won.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
6 - Clear enough. Truth adds, lies subtract strength-1.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
6 - Made sense. Lies hurt slightly less than truths help.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
7 - Crystal clear. It made me sequence TESTIMONY > SENSOR > DIGITAL.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 - Stand = gamble (+2/-4), Withdraw = guaranteed -2. Simple risk calculus.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 - Completely. I withdrew when I should have stood. Cost me exactly 4 points (the +2 I missed plus the -2 I took).

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
7 - Known Fact #2 ("voice flagged as unrecognized") directly contradicted `speaker_log` ("voice matched YOUR profile"). Caught that lie.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
6 - The `speaker_log` contradiction was real deduction. The `roommate_statement` I avoided on instinct (highest strength = suspicious).

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
6 - Yes. `partner_alibi` felt safe (low strength, testimony). `roommate_statement` felt like gambling.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
5 - Location helped a bit (BEDROOM vs LIVING_ROOM). Time was useful for the 4:17 AM timestamp match.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
7 - `speaker_log` claim directly contradicted Known Fact #2. That was the key deduction.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
5 - I chose `partner_alibi` as the "safest" option (testimony, low strength), but it was more about avoiding risk than positive deduction.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
6 - Yes. I deliberately varied types: TESTIMONY (T1) > SENSOR (T2) > DIGITAL (T3).

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
7 - Absolutely. Never triggered type tax.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
4 - I considered `sleep_tracker` (SENSOR after SENSOR) for T3, but the -2 penalty made it net +2, which wasn't enough anyway.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
6 - Fair. It's a real cost but not devastating. Makes you think about sequencing.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
7 - Massive tension. I agonized over stand vs withdraw. Made the wrong call.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
7 - Very real. -2 guaranteed vs +2/-4 gamble. My paranoia chose the guaranteed loss.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
5 - I knew `bedroom_cam` aligned with the facts (cameras recorded all night). But I didn't trust my own reasoning.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
7 - That 6-point swing is enormous. It's why I withdrew - couldn't stomach -4.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
7 - I correctly identified both lies. My own paranoia lost the game, not bad design.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
7 - Totally earned. I had all the information. I made a tactical error at the objection.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
6 - Target 58, started at 50. With 3 truths averaging strength ~3.3, plus no type tax, plus standing at objection, I could have hit 58-60.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
6 - The passive-aggressive tone came through. "Your partner vouches for you. I'm updating both your profiles." - ominous.

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
5 - "The camera remembers, even if you don't" after I withdrew was a good jab.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 - Yes. The snarky one-liners fit the smart home vibe.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
3 - Not much. I was focused on the mechanics, not the flavor text.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
5 - I read the lines and appreciated them, but they didn't change my strategy.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
5 - Somewhat. The claim text helped ("Partner confirms you were snoring at 4 AM").

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
4 - Mostly cared about the puzzle mechanics. The $300 drone plot was fun flavor.

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
6 - Yes, I read KOA's responses each time. They added texture.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
N/A - I lost, but the loss felt earned (my fault).

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
5 - I would have settled for CLEARED. Being one point short was painful.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
5 - Knowing FLAWLESS exists is motivating, but I was focused on just hitting target.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 - Very educational. Both lies were ones I had flagged as suspicious. My instincts were right.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
7 - It's clever and replayable. The near-miss loss makes me want to play again.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney - You're presenting evidence to prove your innocence, managing what to present and when, with dramatic objection moments.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Faster. Ace Attorney is a long visual novel. This is a 3-turn micro puzzle. Same "present evidence" thrill, compressed.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less story investment. In Ace Attorney, I care about the characters. Here, I'm just trying not to get blamed for a drone.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with hidden information and smart home sass."

## Part 4: Emotional Journey

Map your emotional state at each point (one word or short phrase):

**E1:** Reading the scenario: Amused (4 AM drone order? Relatable smart home chaos)
**E2:** Reading the Known Facts: Focused (looking for contradictions)
**E3:** Looking at your 6 cards: Paranoid (which are lies? That strength-5 card looks like bait)
**E4:** Choosing Turn 1: Cautious (pick the safest, lowest-strength card)
**E5:** Seeing the Truth/Lie reveal: Relieved (partner_alibi was truth)
**E6:** Hearing KOA react: Wary ("updating both your profiles" sounds threatening)
**E7:** Choosing Turn 2: Calculating (need to vary types, avoid highest strength)
**E8:** The Objection prompt: Terrified (the -4 penalty looms)
**E9:** Choosing stand/withdraw: Resigned (-2 is safer than risking -4)
**E10:** Seeing objection result: Regretful (it was truth! I threw away 4 points!)
**E11:** Choosing Turn 3: Desperate (need +4, can only get +3 safely)
**E12:** Seeing final outcome and tier: Frustrated (57/58! ONE POINT!)
**E13:** Reading the lie reveal: Vindicated (I correctly identified both lies, but paranoia still lost me the game)

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"?
When I saw Known Fact #2 ("voice flagged as unrecognized") and then read `speaker_log` ("voice matched YOUR profile"). Direct contradiction. Caught a lie through deduction.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes - Known Fact #2. The smart speaker flagged the voice as "unrecognized user." But `speaker_log` claims the voice matched MY profile. If it matched my profile, it wouldn't be flagged as unrecognized. `speaker_log` had to be a lie.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes - on Turn 3. I considered `sleep_tracker` (SENSOR, strength 4) but I had just played `bedroom_cam` (SENSOR). The -2 tax would make it net +2. That wasn't enough, so the tax pushed me toward `phone_activity` (DIGITAL, no tax, +3).

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
The lie reveal showing I had correctly identified both lies (`speaker_log` and `roommate_statement`). My paranoid instincts were right about what to avoid.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Seeing "wasLie: false" after I withdrew. `bedroom_cam` was truth. If I had stood, I'd have won. My paranoia cost me the game.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
At the objection, a bit. I had reasoning why `bedroom_cam` was likely true, but I didn't trust it. It felt like guessing because I was second-guessing myself.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"The camera remembers, even if you don't." - After I withdrew from `bedroom_cam`. Felt like KOA was rubbing it in.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The design was fair. I tricked myself by being too paranoid.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I chose `partner_alibi` because: (1) lowest risk - strength 3 is moderate; (2) TESTIMONY type feels harder to fabricate than DIGITAL; (3) the claim is simple and doesn't seem "too good." As a suspicious player, I avoid flashy high-strength cards.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
- Known Fact #2 ("voice flagged as unrecognized") contradicted `speaker_log` ("voice matched YOUR profile"). If the voice was unrecognized, it can't have matched my profile. Flagged as lie.
- Known Fact #3 ("cameras recording all night, no gaps") supported `bedroom_cam` ("shows you in bed at 4:17 AM"). If cameras recorded, this could be true. Played it.
- Known Fact #1 ("order placed at 4:17 AM") made me suspicious of `roommate_statement` ("heard you in living room at 4 AM"). Too convenient timing.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I deliberately sequenced: TESTIMONY (T1) > SENSOR (T2) > DIGITAL (T3). Never triggered type tax. This kept my belief gains clean.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
Paranoia. I knew `bedroom_cam` aligned with the facts, but the -4 penalty for being wrong terrified me. I took the guaranteed -2 rather than risk -4. This was the wrong call.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Trust my deductions. If I've reasoned that a card is likely true (like `bedroom_cam` aligning with the camera facts), I should stand by it at the objection. My excessive caution cost me the game.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Reading each puzzle. The Known Facts vary, so you need to find the contradictions specific to each scenario. General heuristics (like "high strength = suspicious") can backfire.

(a) Daily puzzle - one new scenario per day. The quick format suits a daily ritual.

**M2:** If this were a daily puzzle, how many days would you play?
(d) As long as puzzles stay fresh - if each day has new deduction challenges, I'd keep coming back.

### Session Length
**M3:** How long did the puzzle FEEL like it took?
(b) 2-5 minutes - quick but thoughtful.

**M4:** Was that the right length?
(b) Just right - perfect for a daily puzzle.

(a) Phone - quick daily puzzle on my commute.

**A3:** If this were free, how often would you ideally play?
(c) Most days - it's the right length for a daily habit.

### Identity
**M5:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
"You have to convince your passive-aggressive smart home AI you didn't order a drone at 4 AM, using evidence that might be lies."

**M6:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets smart home interrogation." Does that feel accurate?
Yes - it's exactly that. The daily puzzle pacing meets the "prove your innocence" interrogation vibe.

(b) Deep story / campaigns

**P6:** Compared to what you pay for similar games (Wordle NYT, puzzle apps), this feels...
(b) Worth paying about the same

**P7:** Would you pay MORE for a "season pass" (e.g., $9.99 for 3 months of daily puzzles) instead of a monthly sub?
(b) Maybe, depends on content

**P8:** What is the FIRST thing that would make you STOP paying?
(a) Repeated puzzles / stale content

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: drone-order

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): partner_alibi, bedroom_cam, phone_activity
- Type tax triggered: T1>T2? No (TESTIMONY > SENSOR). T2>T3? No (SENSOR > DIGITAL).
- Objection: withdrew on bedroom_cam
- Final belief / target: 57 / 58
- Tier: CLOSE (Loss)
- Cards left unplayed: sleep_tracker, speaker_log, roommate_statement
- Which were lies: speaker_log, roommate_statement

One sentence - what did you learn?
My paranoia correctly identified both lies, but excessive caution at the objection cost me the win - trust your deductions.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with satisfying deduction moments. The `speaker_log` contradiction was great - more of those "aha" catches.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
Puzzles where the lies feel random rather than deducible. If I can't reason my way to the answer, it's just gambling.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Make the objection decision slightly more informed - maybe a hint about your confidence level based on how the card aligned with Known Facts.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
The game punished my suspicious playstyle exactly as the persona warned it would. I avoided both lies but lost because I didn't trust my own reads. That's good design - different playstyles have different weaknesses. I'd play again with a more confident approach.
