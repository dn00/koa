## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney — The core loop is similar: you're presented with facts and evidence, and you need to identify contradictions between statements and established truth. The "objection" mechanic even mirrors the courtroom drama of pressing witnesses and presenting evidence.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Brevity. An Ace Attorney cross-examination can take 20-60 minutes. This puzzle took under 5 minutes. The tight constraint of 6 cards and 3 picks creates focused, concentrated deduction without fluff or repeated dialogue.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Narrative depth. Ace Attorney makes you care deeply about the characters and story. Here, the scenario is intriguing but there's no ongoing relationship with KOA or consequences beyond the single puzzle. The emotional stakes are lower.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with Wordle's daily brevity."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When I noticed the `garage_app` card claimed the phone triggered the garage at 2:17 AM, but Known Fact #2 explicitly stated no phone app activity after 11 PM. That was a clear "gotcha" contradiction.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes, two moments:
1. KF2 ("phone showed no app activity after 11 PM") directly contradicted the `garage_app` claim ("manual override triggered from your phone at 2:17 AM").
2. KF3 ("motion was detected near the garage around 2 AM") directly contradicted `motion_garage` claim ("no movement detected overnight").

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Not in terms of which cards I selected (I chose all my SAFE cards regardless), but it influenced my ordering. I specifically sequenced DIGITAL -> TESTIMONY -> SENSOR to avoid any type tax penalties, rather than playing my highest-strength card every turn.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Seeing the final lie reveal confirm that both `garage_app` and `motion_garage` were indeed the lies, exactly as I had predicted from my analysis.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
None. The puzzle was well-calibrated for a methodical approach. If anything, it felt slightly too clean — I never had to make a difficult judgment call.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
No. Every decision was grounded in logical deduction from Known Facts. The two lies had clear contradictions, and the three truths had no contradictions.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Your neighbor's a light sleeper. Lucky for you. Or not." — The ambiguity felt appropriately passive-aggressive.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The rules were clear and the game behaved as documented.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I started with `browser_history` (Strength 4, DIGITAL) because: (1) it was my highest-strength SAFE card, (2) its claim directly aligned with Known Fact #2, giving me high confidence it was truth, and (3) starting with DIGITAL gave me flexibility to play SENSOR or TESTIMONY next without type tax.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
For each card, I checked: "Does this claim contradict any Known Fact?"
- `garage_app` claimed phone activity at 2:17 AM; KF2 said no phone activity after 11 PM. CONTRADICTION.
- `motion_garage` claimed no movement detected; KF3 said motion was detected. CONTRADICTION.
- Other cards either supported or didn't conflict with Known Facts. SAFE.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I ensured each card was a different type: DIGITAL (T1) -> TESTIMONY (T2) -> SENSOR (T3). This avoided all -2 penalties and maximized my score.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
Per my persona: I reasoned `neighbor_testimony` was SAFE before playing it, so I stood by with high confidence. The game even confirmed it was truth (wasLie: false) before the objection, removing all doubt.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Nothing significant. My strategy achieved FLAWLESS. For a harder puzzle with more ambiguous lies, I might need to weigh strength vs. certainty more carefully.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Both. The correct meta-strategy is: identify lies via Known Fact contradictions, avoid those cards, sequence remaining cards to avoid type tax. But each puzzle requires careful reading to spot the specific contradictions.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

### Format
**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
(a) Daily puzzle — one new scenario per day

**M2:** If this were a daily puzzle, how many days would you play?
(d) As long as puzzles stay fresh

### Session Length
**M3:** How long did the puzzle FEEL like it took?
(b) 2-5 minutes

**M4:** Was that the right length?
(b) Just right

### Identity
**M5:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
"A daily logic puzzle where you present evidence to a snarky AI to prove your innocence, but two of your evidence cards are lies."

**M6:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets smart home interrogation." Does that feel accurate?
Yes, that's accurate. The smart home framing (garage doors, sensors, apps) provides a cohesive theme, and the daily puzzle format is clearly the intent.

**M7:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
Harder puzzles with more subtle lies — ones that require cross-referencing cards against each other, not just checking against Known Facts.

### Pricing & Monetization

**P1:** Would you pay for this game?
(a) Yes, one-time purchase

**P2:** If one-time purchase, what's the max you'd pay?
(b) $2.99 - $4.99

**P3:** If subscription, what's the max monthly price you'd pay?
(a) $0.99/month

**P4:** What would make a subscription worth it? (pick all that apply)
(a) New puzzle every day
(c) Weekly story campaigns

**P5:** How does this compare to what you pay for similar games (Wordle NYT, puzzle apps)?
Similar. Wordle is free but this has more depth per puzzle. I'd expect NYT Games bundle pricing ($3-5/month) if this had a large puzzle library.

**P6:** Would you pay MORE for a "season pass" (e.g., $9.99 for 3 months of daily puzzles)?
(b) Maybe, depends on content

**P7:** What would make you STOP paying for a subscription?
Repetitive puzzle structures where the lies become predictable (e.g., always the highest-strength cards, always certain types).

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: garage-door

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): browser_history, neighbor_testimony, sleep_tracker
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No. T2->T3? No.
- Objection: stood on neighbor_testimony
- Final belief / target: 62 / 57
- Tier: FLAWLESS
- Cards left unplayed: car_dashcam, garage_app, motion_garage
- Which were lies: garage_app, motion_garage

One sentence — what did I learn?
The puzzle rewards careful fact-checking: both lies had clear contradictions with Known Facts, and methodical analysis led to a perfect score.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Variety in puzzle difficulty and lie detection methods. Some days should have obvious contradictions (tutorial feel), others should require subtler deduction.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If every puzzle could be solved with the same formula: "check each card against Known Facts, find the two contradictions, play the rest." I need puzzles that challenge different reasoning skills.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Add "relational lies" — cards that don't contradict Known Facts directly but contradict each other. This would make cross-referencing cards more important and increase deduction depth.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
The KOA character has good flavor but doesn't impact gameplay. Consider having KOA's responses contain subtle hints or misdirection that methodical players could analyze.

The core loop is strong. With puzzle variety and increasing complexity, this could be an excellent daily habit game.
