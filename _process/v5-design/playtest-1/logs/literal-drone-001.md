## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
5 — I want to try again to figure out what I did wrong.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
4 — I mostly just picked the strongest cards. There was some tension about avoiding type tax.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
6 — A drone ordered at 4 AM by voice? That's a weird mystery. I was curious.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
5 — In hindsight, maybe I should have thought more about the card claims.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
6 — The rules were clear. Truth adds, lie subtracts, type tax is -2.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
5 — It made sense when I saw it happen. The strength-4 lie cost me 3 points.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
6 — I avoided playing SENSOR after SENSOR on turn 2 because of this.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
5 — Stand for +2 if truth, -4 if lie. Withdraw is -2 flat. Got it.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
4 — I see the math. I just don't really understand why those cards were lies.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
2 — I read them but they didn't really help me decide. I picked by strength.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
3 — Honestly, I was picking strong cards. That felt like a strategy.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
2 — Every card felt like it could be true. I wasn't aware I was gambling.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
3 — I looked at type for tax avoidance. Location and time? Not really.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
2 — I read the claims but didn't cross-check them against the Known Facts.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
3 — I picked sleep_tracker because it was strong and supported my case. I didn't analyze the facts deeply.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
6 — Definitely. I avoided playing SENSOR twice in a row.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
7 — Yes, I specifically chose not to play bedroom_cam after sleep_tracker.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
3 — I never ate the tax this game. I'm not sure when it would be worth it.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
5 — It's a reasonable trade-off. Makes you think about sequencing.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
5 — When I saw the -4 from the lie, I was nervous about the objection.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
4 — For me, standing felt automatic. I don't like admitting mistakes.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
2 — I had just been told it was a lie! But I stood by anyway because that's who I am.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
6 — The -4 really hurt. I went from 50 to 46. That was brutal.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
4 — I lost badly, but I also didn't try to analyze the facts. Maybe it was fair.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
4 — I earned my loss by not thinking carefully. But it also felt like the lies were hard to spot.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
3 — I needed 58 and ended at 43. That's a big gap. Not sure if it was reachable for me.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
5 — The passive-aggressive tone was noticeable. "I'm updating your profile" was ominous.

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
5 — "You're presenting testimony that places you at the scene. I'm... concerned for you." That was good.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 — Yes, very much that vibe. Like a disappointed Alexa.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
3 — I noticed them but didn't change my strategy based on what KOA said.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
5 — I read every line. The tone was entertaining.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
5 — Yes, it felt like I was making arguments to convince KOA.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
4 — I wanted to prove I didn't order the drone. It felt personal.

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
6 — I read everything. KOA's responses were part of the experience.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
N/A — I lost.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
4 — I just wanted to clear. Flawless wasn't on my radar.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
3 — Not really. I was playing by strength, not by analysis.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
5 — Educational. Now I see that roommate_statement and speaker_log were both lies. Interesting.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
6 — It's clever, but I got destroyed. I'd tell a friend it's tricky.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney — You're presenting evidence to prove your case, and getting caught in contradictions hurts you.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
It's much shorter. A full case in Ace Attorney takes hours. This was a few minutes.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth. In Ace Attorney, you really understand why evidence contradicts. Here I still don't quite get why the roommate was lying.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with a smart home AI and hidden lies in your own evidence."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When the lie reveal showed both roommate_statement and speaker_log were lies. I played both of them!

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
No. Looking back, the Known Fact said "Smart speaker flagged the voice as unrecognized user" which contradicts speaker_log claiming "voice matched YOUR profile." I didn't catch that.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes, on Turn 2 I avoided bedroom_cam (SENSOR) because I had just played sleep_tracker (SENSOR).

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Turn 1 when sleep_tracker was revealed as truth and I got +4.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Standing by the roommate_statement and eating -4 more. That really hurt.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Not really. I felt like I was making choices based on strength. I didn't realize I was essentially guessing on content.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"You stood by testimony that places you at the scene. I'm updating your profile."

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No, the design was fair. I just didn't use it properly.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I picked sleep_tracker because it had strength 4 and directly claimed I was asleep. Strong card, good claim.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
I read them at the start but didn't actively reference them when picking cards. I just trusted the card claims at face value.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I avoided SENSOR on Turn 2 after playing SENSOR on Turn 1. But it didn't help me win.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
I stood by because I had already committed to the card. Withdrawing felt like admitting I was wrong. But I was wrong.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Actually cross-reference the card claims against the Known Facts. The speaker_log claimed voice matched my profile, but the Known Facts said it was "unrecognized user." That's a direct contradiction I missed.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Reading each puzzle. The Known Facts are key. Strength alone isn't enough.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: drone-order

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): sleep_tracker, roommate_statement, speaker_log
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No. T2->T3? No.
- Objection: stood on roommate_statement (was lie, -4)
- Final belief / target: 43 / 58
- Tier: BUSTED
- Cards left unplayed: partner_alibi, phone_activity, bedroom_cam
- Which were lies: roommate_statement, speaker_log

One sentence — what did you learn?
I learned that picking cards by strength alone is a trap; you have to actually check if the claims contradict the Known Facts.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
New scenarios with interesting mysteries. The smart home setting has lots of potential.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If all puzzles felt the same or if I couldn't learn from my mistakes.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
After the game, show exactly which Known Fact each lie contradicted. Help me learn.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
I got completely destroyed. I played 2 of the 2 lies in the deck. The roommate statement was high strength (5) and seemed helpful, but it contradicted my defense by putting me in the living room at 4 AM. The speaker log claimed voice matched my profile but the Known Facts said it was "unrecognized user." I should have caught both of these. The game works — it caught me being lazy about deduction.
