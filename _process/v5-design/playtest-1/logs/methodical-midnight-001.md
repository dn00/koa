**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play. **5**
**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened. **6**
**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently. **4** (I won flawlessly, so less reflection needed)

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing. **7**
**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive. **6**

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts. **7**

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order. **6**
**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back. **7**
**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card. **3** (never faced this tradeoff - my SAFE cards were all different types)

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
**Ace Attorney** - The core loop of presenting evidence to build belief, having your evidence challenged (objection), and the satisfaction of catching lies feels very similar to cross-examination sequences. The Known Facts function like case files you use to spot contradictions.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Faster pacing. A single puzzle takes 3-5 minutes vs hours for an Ace Attorney case. The type tax adds a layer of tactical card management that Ace Attorney lacks.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth. Ace Attorney has characters, plot twists, and emotional stakes. This puzzle feels more abstract - I'm solving a logic puzzle rather than saving an innocent client.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with Wordle's daily puzzle format."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When I realized that both DANGEROUS cards (email_draft at 11:30 PM and printer_queue at 3 AM) were the lies. The puzzle design placed the lies exactly where logical deduction said they would be - cards that incriminate you are fabricated.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes. Known Fact #3 (bed by 11 PM) directly contradicted email_draft's claim of "late-night work activity" at 11:30 PM. If I was in bed by 11, I could not have been working at 11:30. This flagged email_draft as DANGEROUS immediately.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
It influenced my order planning. After Turn 1 (SENSOR), I noted motion_hallway was also SENSOR and would incur the tax. This reinforced avoiding it, though I was already suspicious of that card for other reasons.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
The lie reveal at the end confirming that my DANGEROUS categorization was correct. Both lies were exactly the cards I had flagged as contradicting my innocence.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
None, honestly. The puzzle worked smoothly for my systematic approach.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
No. Every card pick was backed by explicit reasoning against the Known Facts. The SAFE/SUSPICIOUS/DANGEROUS framework gave me clear decision criteria.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"In bed by 11. That's what partners are supposed to say." - A nice passive-aggressive jab implying partner testimony might be unreliable. It made me second-guess briefly, but my logic held.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The design felt fair. The lies were logically detectable through the Known Facts.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I categorized all 6 cards as SAFE/SUSPICIOUS/DANGEROUS based on whether they contradicted Known Facts. I found 3 SAFE cards (smart_lock, partner_testimony, browser_history) and picked smart_lock first because it had the highest strength (4) among SAFE cards and directly supported a Known Fact (door stayed locked).

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
For each card, I checked if the claim contradicted any Known Fact:
- email_draft (11:30 PM work) vs Fact #3 (bed by 11 PM) = CONTRADICTION
- printer_queue (sent from my laptop at 3 AM) = SELF-INCRIMINATING (proves guilt)
- motion_hallway (2:30 AM motion) = SUSPICIOUS (implies I was awake/moving)
- smart_lock, partner_testimony, browser_history = support my alibi, no contradictions

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I planned to play all three different types (SENSOR, TESTIMONY, DIGITAL) to avoid any tax. This worked perfectly - no penalties.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
Per my persona rules: "If you reasoned the card was SAFE, stand by. If SUSPICIOUS, withdraw." partner_testimony was SAFE (directly supports Fact #3), so I stood by with confidence.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Very little. My approach worked optimally. Perhaps I would experiment with playing a SUSPICIOUS card on Turn 3 if already at CLEARED tier, to test if my suspicion was warranted.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
There is a correct framework: categorize cards by contradiction with Known Facts, then prioritize SAFE cards with type diversity. But each puzzle requires fresh analysis - the specific lies depend on the scenario.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

### Format
**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
(c) Both - Daily puzzles for routine play, multi-act story for deeper engagement

**M2:** If this were a daily puzzle, how many days would you play?
(d) As long as puzzles stay fresh

### Session Length
**M3:** How long did the puzzle FEEL like it took?
(c) 5-10 minutes (due to methodical analysis before each pick)

**M4:** Was that the right length?
(b) Just right

### Identity
**M5:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
"A logic puzzle where you present evidence to your smart home AI, but 2 of your 6 cards are lies and you have to figure out which ones before they tank your score."

**M6:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets smart home interrogation." Does that feel accurate?
Yes, though "interrogation" undersells it. It's more like "smart home defense" - you're defending yourself TO the smart home.

**M7:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
More varied puzzle scenarios with different deduction patterns. The midnight print job had clear contradictions; puzzles with more ambiguous lies would increase replayability.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: The Midnight Print Job

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): smart_lock, partner_testimony, browser_history
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (SENSOR->TESTIMONY) T2->T3? No (TESTIMONY->DIGITAL)
- Objection: stood on partner_testimony
- Final belief / target: 62 / 57
- Tier: FLAWLESS
- Cards left unplayed: motion_hallway, email_draft, printer_queue
- Which were lies: email_draft, printer_queue

One sentence - what did you learn?
Cards that contradict Known Facts or self-incriminate are the lies; systematic categorization before playing eliminates guesswork.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with clever lies that require genuine deduction. Leaderboards comparing scores/tiers with friends.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
Repetitive lie patterns (always the self-incriminating cards are lies), or scenarios that feel arbitrary rather than deducible.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Add a "confidence" mechanic - let players mark which cards they think are lies before playing, with bonus points for correct predictions. This would reward deduction over just safe play.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
The puzzle design was well-crafted. The lies were logically detectable through the Known Facts, which made winning feel earned. KOA's passive-aggressive personality adds flavor without being distracting. The type tax mechanic is elegant - it creates interesting decisions without being too punishing. Overall, a polished puzzle experience.
