## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 — The deduction was engaging and I wanted to test my methodology on another scenario.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
5 — Moderate tension on Turn 1 when categorizing cards, but once I identified the lies, subsequent choices felt more confident.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
6 — The "car went for a joyride" mystery was compelling. Who actually drove the car if not me?

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
4 — I felt my strategy was sound, though I wondered if I could have achieved FLAWLESS with different sequencing.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
7 — The rules were clear and well-explained. Truth adds strength, lies subtract strength-1, type tax -2 for repeats.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
6 — Straightforward once understood, though the "strength-1" for lies took a moment to internalize.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
7 — Very clear. I planned my sequence specifically to avoid it: SENSOR -> DIGITAL -> TESTIMONY.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 — Clear risk/reward: +2 if right vs -4 if wrong vs guaranteed -2 for withdraw.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 — Yes, 4+3+2+3 = 12 added to starting 50 = 62, beating target of 60. CLEARED tier made sense.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
7 — Critical for my analysis. KF2 (phone on WiFi) confirmed phone_gps was safe. The lies were identified by recognizing they proved guilt, not innocence.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
7 — My systematic fact-checking methodology gave me high confidence in each play.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
7 — Clear distinction: dashcam and gas_receipt would prove I was driving/at the gas station, which contradicts my defense of being asleep.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
5 — Type was useful for avoiding tax. Time helped identify contradictions (2:15 AM dashcam vs being in bed).

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
7 — The claims were essential. "Dashcam shows you in the driver's seat at 2:15 AM" clearly contradicts the defense of being asleep.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
7 — I had four cards I categorized as SAFE. sleep_cam was a strong reasoned choice.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
7 — I explicitly planned SENSOR -> DIGITAL -> TESTIMONY to avoid all type tax.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
7 — Successfully avoided all type tax throughout the game.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
3 — Never faced this tradeoff since my safe cards had different types.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
6 — Fair penalty that creates meaningful sequencing decisions without being crippling.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
6 — There was a moment of doubt before confirming my reasoning was sound.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
5 — For me, it was clear because I had high confidence in phone_gps. But I can see how it would be tense with a SUSPICIOUS card.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
7 — My Turn 0 analysis told me phone_gps matched Known Fact #2 exactly.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
6 — A 6-point swing is significant when the target is 60 and you're at 57.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
7 — The lies were identifiable through logical reasoning, not hidden arbitrarily.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
7 — I earned the CLEARED tier through systematic deduction and risk avoidance.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
6 — Reachable with good play, but playing a lie would have made it very difficult.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
5 — KOA had personality, but interactions were brief.

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
5 — "Partner says you never left bed. Partners do say that." had a nice skeptical tone.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 — The skeptical, sardonic tone fit the passive-aggressive AI character.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
3 — KOA's comments were flavor; my decisions were based on Known Facts analysis.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
5 — I noted KOA's responses but they didn't change my strategy.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
6 — The claim-based cards did feel like presenting a defense to a skeptical AI.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
5 — I was curious about the mystery, though mainly focused on the puzzle mechanics.

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
6 — I read KOA's responses and found them entertaining.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
7 — I identified both lies and played three truths. That's skill, not luck.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
5 — I achieved CLEARED and was satisfied, though FLAWLESS would have been nice.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
6 — Knowing FLAWLESS existed made me consider optimization.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 — Very satisfying to see "liesRevealed: dashcam, gas_receipt" — exactly what I predicted.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
8 — A clever deduction puzzle with good design. Would recommend to puzzle game fans.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney — You're presenting evidence to prove innocence against a skeptical authority figure, with the tension of not knowing if your evidence will hold up.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Brevity. Ace Attorney trials are lengthy; this distills the "present evidence" tension into a 3-minute puzzle.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Character depth. Ace Attorney has memorable characters and story arcs; KOA is entertaining but shallow by comparison.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with Wordle-length sessions and a snarky AI."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
Realizing that dashcam and gas_receipt would prove GUILT, not innocence. They claim I was driving/at the gas station — that's the opposite of helpful evidence. That insight categorized them as definite lies.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Not directly, but inversely: Known Fact #2 (phone on home WiFi all night) confirmed phone_gps was true. The lies were identified by logical contradiction with my defense, not direct fact conflict.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes, at Turn 3. I had sleep_meds and spouse_alibi as options (both TESTIMONY, strength 3). Either worked, but I specifically avoided playing dashcam (SENSOR) which would have triggered tax from Turn 1's SENSOR card if I had played it Turn 2.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Seeing "liesRevealed: dashcam, gas_receipt" at the end — exactly the two cards I flagged as DANGEROUS in my Turn 0 analysis. My methodology worked.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
None, really. The puzzle was well-designed and my approach worked.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
No. My systematic fact-checking gave me high confidence in every decision.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Partner says you never left bed. Partners do say that." — Perfect passive-aggressive skepticism.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The lies were fair — they were identifiable through careful reasoning about what constitutes helpful vs harmful evidence.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I chose sleep_cam (strength 4, SENSOR) because it was my highest-strength SAFE card. It shows me in bed at 2:10 AM, supporting my alibi without any fact contradiction.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
I listed all 4 Known Facts, then checked each card's claim against them. KF2 (phone on WiFi) confirmed phone_gps. The key insight was that dashcam and gas_receipt don't contradict facts — they contradict my DEFENSE. Evidence showing me driving or at a gas station proves guilt, making them useless as defense cards and therefore lies.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I planned SENSOR -> DIGITAL -> TESTIMONY to avoid all type tax. This was possible because my four SAFE cards had three different types.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
I stood because phone_gps was categorized SAFE with high confidence — its claim matched Known Fact #2 exactly. Per my persona, SAFE cards warrant standing by.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
I might explore whether FLAWLESS was achievable with different sequencing. But my conservative approach achieved a clear win, so minimal regrets.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Both. The meta-strategy (identify lies via fact-checking, avoid type tax, stand by SAFE cards) is consistent, but each puzzle requires fresh analysis of how claims relate to Known Facts.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: midnight-drive

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): sleep_cam, phone_gps, spouse_alibi
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (SENSOR->DIGITAL). T2->T3? No (DIGITAL->TESTIMONY)
- Objection: stood on phone_gps
- Final belief / target: 62 / 60
- Tier: CLEARED
- Cards left unplayed: sleep_meds, dashcam, gas_receipt
- Which were lies: dashcam, gas_receipt

One sentence — what did you learn?
Evidence that proves guilt cannot be helpful defense evidence — this insight immediately identifies lie cards that seem high-value but would actually harm your case.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with interesting mysteries, varied Known Facts that require different reasoning approaches, and KOA developing more personality over time.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
Repetitive puzzle structures where the lies are always identifiable the same way, or scenarios that feel arbitrary rather than solvable through logic.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
More KOA dialogue and reactivity. The AI character is the unique hook — lean into it with more memorable lines and personality.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
Strong core loop. The tension between "this card looks good but might be a lie" is compelling. The fact-checking deduction feels rewarding when it works. The type tax adds just enough sequencing complexity without overwhelming. Good design.
