## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 — The win felt good and I'm curious if my gut would work on other scenarios.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
6 — Especially on Turn 2 and 3, where the stakes felt real and I had to trust my instincts.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
5 — The midnight joyride mystery was fun, though I never found out WHO actually drove the car.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
4 — I won, so not much regret, but I wondered if spouse_alibi would have worked too.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
6 — The rules were clear enough to play without confusion.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
5 — I understood it but had to consciously think about it during play.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
6 — Clear and I actively avoided triggering it by varying my card types.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 — Very clear. Stand = double down, withdraw = safe retreat.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 — The math tracked perfectly and the lie reveal confirmed my suspicions.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
5 — The facts helped, but my gut did most of the work - the "incriminating" cards just felt wrong.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
5 — It felt like informed intuition rather than pure deduction or pure guessing.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
6 — sleep_meds felt safe, gas_receipt felt like a gamble I refused to take.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
6 — The time stamps were crucial - 2:15 AM dashcam vs 2:10 AM sleep_cam raised red flags.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
5 — The claims themselves felt more narratively right or wrong than logically contradictory.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
6 — phone_gps aligned directly with the Known Fact that my phone stayed on home WiFi.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
5 — I considered it when sequencing but it wasn't the primary driver of my choices.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
6 — I went DIGITAL -> SENSOR -> TESTIMONY specifically to avoid the penalty.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
4 — I never faced this choice directly since my preferred cards were different types.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
6 — Seems reasonable as a sequencing constraint without being game-breaking.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
7 — This was the most intense moment. Standing by felt like a real commitment.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
6 — It felt meaningful because I had to back up my gut feeling with stakes.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
6 — I knew my card had paid off (+4 belief), which gave me confidence to stand.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
7 — The asymmetry made it genuinely tense. Getting it wrong would hurt badly.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
6 — Challenging but not unfair. My reasoning was rewarded.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
7 — I successfully avoided the traps by trusting my instincts. Felt earned.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
6 — 60 was tight. I finished at 62, so there wasn't much margin for error.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
6 — The passive-aggressive tone came through clearly in the responses.

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
6 — "Bedroom footage holds. Somehow." made me smile.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 — Definitely snarky smart home vibes, not courtroom judge vibes.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
5 — I noticed the skeptical tone but didn't change my strategy based on it.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
6 — I read every line and enjoyed the personality, though the score mattered more.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
6 — It felt like making arguments to a skeptical AI, which was immersive.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
5 — I wanted to win, but I also wanted to understand what "really happened."

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
7 — I read everything carefully. The flavor text was part of the experience.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
7 — I avoided the lies through intuition and reasoning. Felt earned.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
5 — I was happy with CLEARED but wondered if I could have done better.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
5 — I focused on hitting the target rather than maximizing score.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 — Very satisfying! Confirmed my gut feelings about dashcam and gas_receipt.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
8 — Fun, quick, and satisfying. Would recommend to puzzle game fans.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney — You're presenting evidence to convince someone of your innocence, with a skeptical "opponent" (KOA) pushing back. The objection mechanic especially feels like courtroom drama.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Faster. Ace Attorney requires hours; this is a 5-minute puzzle. Same satisfaction, fraction of the time.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less story depth. Ace Attorney has elaborate cases with twists. This is a snapshot, not a full narrative.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with a smart home AI and daily puzzle format."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When the lie reveal showed dashcam and gas_receipt were both lies. My gut was right! The "incriminating" cards were traps.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
The dashcam claimed to show me in the car at 2:15 AM, but the sleep_cam showed me in bed at 2:10 AM. A 5-minute window to get dressed, leave the house, and get in the car? Felt impossible. The timeline conflict made dashcam feel like a lie.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
I consciously sequenced DIGITAL -> SENSOR -> TESTIMONY to avoid the -2 penalty, but my preferred cards happened to be different types anyway, so it didn't force a difficult choice.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Standing by sleep_cam at the objection and getting +2. It validated my gut feeling and moved me to 59, within striking distance of the target.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
None really. The game flowed well. If anything, I briefly worried that spouse_alibi might have been safer than sleep_meds, but both worked.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Turn 3 had a slight "I hope I'm right" feeling, but it was more informed intuition than pure guessing. I had reasons to trust sleep_meds.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Bedroom footage holds. Somehow." — The grudging acceptance was perfectly passive-aggressive.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The design felt fair. The lies were identifiable through careful attention to claims and timeline.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I picked phone_gps because it aligned directly with a Known Fact (phone stayed connected to home WiFi). It felt like a safe, verifiable claim that KOA couldn't dispute. Starting with something grounded felt right.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
- Phone on WiFi all night -> phone_gps claim matches this perfectly
- Door opened at 2:05 AM and 3:55 AM -> someone left and returned (not necessarily me)
- Only my key fob used -> suspicious, but I could have left the fob somewhere accessible
- dashcam at 2:15 AM contradicts sleep_cam at 2:10 AM -> can't be in both places
- gas_receipt at 3:30 AM during the drive -> seems to prove I was out, too incriminating to be helpful

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I sequenced DIGITAL (phone_gps) -> SENSOR (sleep_cam) -> TESTIMONY (sleep_meds) specifically to avoid the -2 penalty each turn.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
My gut said sleep_cam felt right when I played it. The +4 belief confirmed it was truth. KOA's response was skeptical but not accusatory. Everything felt consistent, so I stood by it. Trust the gut.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
I might have been bolder earlier. I stuck to "safe" cards but spouse_alibi was also truth. Maybe I could have aimed for FLAWLESS by playing higher-risk truths if I'd trusted my deduction more.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Reading each puzzle. The lies are puzzle-specific, so you need to analyze the scenario and Known Facts fresh each time. No universal strategy beyond "avoid contradictions."

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
New scenarios that feel fresh and surprising. Different themes (not just smart home — maybe office, travel, relationships). Streak rewards.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
Repetitive scenarios or mechanics that feel solved. If I can predict the lie pattern, the game loses its appeal.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Add a brief epilogue explaining what "actually happened" after the lie reveal. I still don't know who drove my car!

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
Great micro-puzzle format. KOA's personality is the secret sauce — make sure every puzzle has good snark. The objection mechanic is particularly tense and well-designed. Consider adding difficulty levels for replayability.
