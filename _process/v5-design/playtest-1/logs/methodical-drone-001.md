## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 — The deduction process was engaging and I immediately wanted to try a harder puzzle.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
5 — The initial card selection had moderate tension; once I identified the contradiction in speaker_log, I felt more confident.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
6 — A smart speaker ordering a drone at 4 AM is a fun, relatable smart-home anxiety scenario.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
4 — I won, so not much regret, but I wondered if I could have reached FLAWLESS with different choices.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
7 — The briefing was clear about scoring, type tax, and objection mechanics.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
6 — Simple enough, though I had to re-read to confirm lies subtract (strength-1).

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
7 — Clear and well-explained.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 — The +2/-4 vs -2 stakes were crystal clear.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 — Final belief of 62 made sense: 50 + 4 (sleep_tracker) + 3 (partner_alibi) + 2 (stand bonus) + 3 (phone_activity) = 62.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
7 — KF2 ("voice flagged as unrecognized user") directly contradicted speaker_log's claim about matching my profile.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
7 — The contradiction between KF2 and speaker_log was a clear logical deduction.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
6 — I was confident about speaker_log being a lie; roommate_statement felt suspicious but less certain.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
5 — Time was useful (4:17 AM alignment), location somewhat (living room vs bedroom), type mainly for tax planning.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
7 — The claims were essential. Comparing "voice matched YOUR profile" against "voice flagged as unrecognized user" was the key deduction.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
7 — Multiple cards seemed safe; sleep_tracker had no contradictions and high strength.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
6 — I deliberately alternated SENSOR -> TESTIMONY -> DIGITAL to avoid any tax.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
7 — Consciously chose partner_alibi (TESTIMONY) after sleep_tracker (SENSOR) to avoid tax.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
3 — Did not apply to my run; I had enough type variety among safe cards.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
6 — It's a meaningful but manageable penalty that rewards planning.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
6 — Even though I was confident, the +2/-4 swing made me pause and re-verify my reasoning.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
5 — For me it was clear (partner_alibi had no contradictions), but I can see it being harder with uncertain cards.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
6 — I had reasoned partner_alibi was safe, so standing felt justified.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
6 — A 6-point swing is significant when target is 58.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
6 — The contradiction in speaker_log was discoverable with careful reading.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
7 — I methodically identified the lies and played safe cards. Victory felt earned.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
5 — Target of 58 from 50 required +8, which was achievable with 3 safe cards.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
5 — Lines like "I'm updating both your profiles" had personality.

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
5 — "The wrist that ordered a drone... also logged deep sleep" was clever.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 — The dry observations fit the smart home AI persona.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
3 — Not really; I relied on my deduction, not KOA's commentary.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
5 — I read the lines but didn't use them for strategy.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
6 — The scenario made it feel like I was defending myself to an AI.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
5 — I wanted to clear my name, not just hit the target.

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
6 — I read KOA's responses and found them entertaining.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
7 — I correctly identified both lies through deduction.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
5 — I noticed I was 1 point short (62 vs 63) and felt a small pang of missed perfection.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
5 — Knowing FLAWLESS existed made me consider higher-strength options.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 — Seeing speaker_log and roommate_statement confirmed as lies validated my reasoning.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
8 — Fun deduction puzzle with a clever premise and satisfying "aha" moments.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney — You're presenting evidence to prove your innocence, cross-referencing claims against established facts, with a confrontational AI playing the role of prosecutor.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Faster. Ace Attorney has long dialogue sequences; this is a tight 3-turn puzzle with immediate feedback.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less story depth. Ace Attorney has character arcs and dramatic reveals; this is a single scenario without emotional stakes.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with Wordle-style daily micro-puzzles."

## Part 4: Emotional Journey

Map your emotional state at each point (one word or short phrase):

**E1:** Reading the scenario: Amused (a drone ordered at 4 AM is a funny premise)
**E2:** Reading the Known Facts: Focused (looking for anchors to reason from)
**E3:** Looking at your 6 cards: Analytical (time to categorize)
**E4:** Choosing Turn 1: Confident (sleep_tracker had no contradictions)
**E5:** Seeing the Truth/Lie reveal: Validated (my SAFE categorization was correct)
**E6:** Hearing KOA react: Entertained ("the wrist that ordered a drone" was witty)
**E7:** Choosing Turn 2: Methodical (partner_alibi fits the pattern)
**E8:** The Objection prompt: Alert (the stakes jumped)
**E9:** Choosing stand/withdraw: Certain (no contradictions meant stand)
**E10:** Seeing objection result: Relieved (another truth, +2 bonus)
**E11:** Choosing Turn 3: Relaxed (already past target, just finishing)
**E12:** Seeing final outcome and tier: Satisfied (CLEARED, well played)
**E13:** Reading the lie reveal: Vindicated (I correctly flagged both lies)

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
Reading speaker_log and realizing it claimed "voice matched YOUR profile" while KF2 said "voice flagged as unrecognized user." Direct contradiction. That was my "aha" moment.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes. KF2 ("Smart speaker flagged the voice as unrecognized user") directly contradicted speaker_log's claim that "Speaker log shows voice matched YOUR profile." If the voice was unrecognized, it couldn't have matched my profile. This was the clearest lie detection.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes. After playing sleep_tracker (SENSOR), I chose partner_alibi (TESTIMONY) over bedroom_cam (also SENSOR) specifically to avoid the -2 tax, even though bedroom_cam also seemed safe.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
The lie reveal at the end confirming both speaker_log and roommate_statement were lies. My methodical approach had correctly identified the dangerous cards.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Slight frustration at ending with 62/63 for FLAWLESS. If I had played one more point somewhere, I could have achieved perfection.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
No. The speaker_log contradiction was clear. Roommate_statement was flagged as suspicious because its claim hurt my case (saying I was talking in the living room). I avoided both.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"The wrist that ordered a drone... also logged deep sleep. Interesting data." — clever skepticism.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The puzzle felt fair. The contradiction was discoverable through careful reading.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I chose sleep_tracker because: (1) Strength 4 was highest among my SAFE cards, (2) The claim didn't contradict any Known Fact, (3) Starting with SENSOR gave me flexibility for type sequencing.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
I listed all 4 Known Facts, then checked each card's claim against them. KF2 ("voice flagged as unrecognized user") was the key. When speaker_log claimed "voice matched YOUR profile," I spotted the direct contradiction. KF3 about continuous camera recording made bedroom_cam seem credible. KF4 about package acceptance didn't help identify lies but established the scenario.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I deliberately planned SENSOR (T1) -> TESTIMONY (T2) -> DIGITAL (T3) to avoid any type tax penalties. I had safe cards in each category, so this was achievable.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
My persona says: stand if SAFE, withdraw if SUSPICIOUS. Partner_alibi was categorized SAFE (no contradictions with Known Facts). Therefore, I stood by with high confidence.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
I might consider whether playing bedroom_cam (SENSOR) on T3 would work despite the type tax, if it let me use a higher-strength card elsewhere. But given I won, not much to change.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Reading each puzzle. The Known Facts are different each time, so the deduction process depends on the specific contradictions available. The methodical approach of fact-checking works, but the specific lies change.

**M2:** If this were a daily puzzle, how many days would you play?
(d) As long as puzzles stay fresh. If the scenarios and lie patterns vary enough, I'd keep playing.

### Session Length
**M3:** How long did the puzzle FEEL like it took?
(b) 2-5 minutes. Initial analysis took a bit, then turns were quick.

**M4:** Was that the right length?
(b) Just right. Perfect for a coffee break puzzle.

### Audience & Channels
**A1:** Where would you MOST expect to find this game?
(b) Web browser — similar to Wordle's distribution model.

**A2:** What device would you MOST want to play on?
(a) Phone — ideal for daily puzzle habit.

**A3:** If this were free, how often would you ideally play?

### Identity
**M5:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
"A daily deduction puzzle where you prove to your passive-aggressive smart home AI that you didn't order a drone at 4 AM."

**M6:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets smart home interrogation." Does that feel accurate?
Yes, though "interrogation" feels slightly strong. It's more "smart home skepticism" than interrogation.

**M7:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
More varied contradiction types. The KF2/speaker_log contradiction was clear; I'd want puzzles where lies are subtler (timeline inconsistencies, location conflicts).

(b) Worth paying about the same

**P7:** Would you pay MORE for a "season pass" (e.g., $9.99 for 3 months of daily puzzles) instead of a monthly sub?
(b) Maybe, depends on content

**P8:** What is the FIRST thing that would make you STOP paying?
(a) Repeated puzzles / stale content

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: drone-order

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): sleep_tracker, partner_alibi, phone_activity
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (SENSOR->TESTIMONY) | T2->T3? No (TESTIMONY->DIGITAL)
- Objection: stood on partner_alibi
- Final belief / target: 62 / 58
- Tier: CLEARED
- Cards left unplayed: bedroom_cam, speaker_log, roommate_statement
- Which were lies: speaker_log, roommate_statement

One sentence — what did you learn?
The Known Facts are the key to lie detection; speaker_log's claim directly contradicted KF2 about the voice being unrecognized, making it an obvious lie to avoid.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with varied contradiction types — timeline puzzles, location-based lies, cross-referencing between cards. If each day felt like a new deduction challenge, I'd return daily.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the lies became predictable (always the highest-strength cards, always the same contradiction patterns). Variety is key.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Add harder puzzles where lies don't directly contradict Known Facts but instead contradict other cards — this would catch my persona's weakness (focusing on facts, not cross-referencing cards).

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
The KOA character is a fun framing device. The passive-aggressive smart home AI fits the zeitgeist of everyone's complicated relationship with Alexa/Google Home. The core deduction loop is solid. I'd enjoy a "hard mode" where lies are subtler and require cross-card analysis.
