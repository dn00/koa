## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 — After hitting FLAWLESS, I felt that rush of "I want to try another one and see if my gut works again."

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
5 — The tension was real, especially deciding between safer cards and the tempting high-strength ones like printer_queue.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
6 — The 3 AM confidential printing mystery was intriguing. Who DID print those documents if not me?

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
4 — Since I won, not much second-guessing, but I wondered what would have happened if I'd played motion_hallway.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
6 — The briefing was clear. Truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1, type tax for repeats.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
6 — Made sense. Lies hurt slightly less than truths help, which feels fair.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
7 — Crystal clear. I actively avoided playing SENSOR after SENSOR on Turn 2.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 — Stand by is a bet that you played truth, withdraw is cutting your losses. Got it.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 — 4 + 3 + 2 (objection) + 3 = 12 points added to starting 50 = 62. Perfect clarity.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
5 — The "in bed by 11 PM" fact helped me feel suspicious of the 11:30 PM email_draft.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
5 — My gut reasoning felt informed, not random. The printer_queue felt like an obvious trap.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
6 — smart_lock felt safe because it matched a known fact. printer_queue felt like gambling.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
5 — Time was most useful. 2:30 AM and 3:00 AM timings felt suspicious near the incident.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
5 — The email_draft claim (11:30 PM work) contradicted my 11 PM bedtime story.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
7 — smart_lock directly matched the "front door stayed locked" fact. Easy first pick.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
6 — I specifically avoided motion_hallway on Turn 2 partly because of the SENSOR tax.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
7 — Never triggered type tax. Went SENSOR then TESTIMONY then DIGITAL.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
3 — Didn't encounter this tradeoff since I avoided same-type plays entirely.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
6 — It's a meaningful cost but not game-ending. Felt balanced.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
6 — KOA's skeptical "That's what partners are supposed to say" made me pause before standing by.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
5 — My gut said stand, but KOA's tone almost made me second-guess myself.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
6 — I knew the card felt right when I played it. That was enough for me.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
6 — +2 if right, -4 if wrong. That asymmetry made me think twice.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
6 — Two lies in six cards meant I needed to avoid 1/3 of my hand. Felt reasonable.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
7 — I identified the lies through reasoning (contradictions, suspicious timings). Earned.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
5 — Starting at 50, needing 57, playing 3 cards. Felt achievable without being trivial.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
6 — "I'm not mad, I'm just... processing" — that opening line sold me on KOA's personality.

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
6 — "That's what partners are supposed to say" was perfectly passive-aggressive.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
7 — The tone was consistently "disappointed parent" energy. Nailed it.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
4 — KOA's skepticism almost made me withdraw, but I trusted my gut over KOA's shade.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
6 — Every KOA line added flavor. "The mystery thickens" after smart_lock was fun.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
6 — Each card was a piece of my alibi. The courtroom feeling was there.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
5 — I genuinely wanted to prove I didn't print those confidential documents!

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
7 — KOA's responses were part of the experience. Would have missed the charm otherwise.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
7 — Three truths, one correct stand by. My instincts worked.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
6 — After hitting CLEARED at Turn 2, I definitely pushed for FLAWLESS with browser_history.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
5 — Knowing FLAWLESS existed made me want to optimize, not just survive.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 — Seeing email_draft and printer_queue as lies validated my gut feelings about them.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
8 — It's clever, quick, and has personality. Would recommend to puzzle-loving friends.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney — The feeling of presenting evidence to convince a skeptical authority figure, with the narrative flavor and objection mechanic, strongly echoes Phoenix Wright.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
It's faster. Ace Attorney can drag with long dialogue and pixel hunting. This is a tight 3-turn experience.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth. Ace Attorney has twisting mysteries with multiple witnesses. This is a snapshot, not a story.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with a passive-aggressive Alexa and daily puzzle format."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When the lie reveal showed email_draft and printer_queue, I went "aha!" — my gut correctly flagged both. The 11:30 PM timing contradicted my 11 PM bedtime, and printer_queue literally incriminated me.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes. The Known Fact "You told KOA you were in bed by 11 PM" made email_draft (11:30 PM work activity) feel like a contradiction. If I was in bed by 11 PM, I couldn't have been saving email drafts at 11:30 PM.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes, on Turn 2. I avoided motion_hallway partly because it was SENSOR type (same as smart_lock from Turn 1). The -2 penalty wasn't the only reason, but it reinforced my decision to play partner_testimony instead.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Standing by partner_testimony and being right. KOA's skeptical tone almost made me doubt myself, but trusting my gut paid off with +2 bonus.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
None, really. The game flowed well. If anything, I wish I knew WHY printer_queue was a lie in the fiction — who actually printed those documents?

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
No. Each choice felt informed by gut reasoning. smart_lock matched a known fact, partner_testimony matched my story, browser_history fit the timeline. Not guessing.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"That's what partners are supposed to say." — Perfect passive-aggressive shade. Made me feel like KOA was judging my relationship.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The lies felt fair. printer_queue looked tempting with its high strength, but the claim was self-incriminating. Good design, not gotcha.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
smart_lock felt like the safest opening. Its claim (no unlock events) matched the Known Fact (front door stayed locked). High strength (4) with maximum confidence. No brainer.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
- "Front door stayed locked" — Validated smart_lock
- "In bed by 11 PM" — Made email_draft (11:30 PM) suspicious, validated partner_testimony (11 PM)
- "Printer warmed up around 3 AM" — Made printer_queue feel like a trap (it shows MY laptop at 3 AM, not good)

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. After playing SENSOR (smart_lock), I consciously picked TESTIMONY (partner_testimony) to avoid the -2. Then DIGITAL (browser_history) on Turn 3.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
Pure gut. When I played partner_testimony, it felt right — the story was coherent, the timing matched. KOA's skepticism almost shook me, but I committed to my instinct.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Same strategy probably. Maybe I'd take more risks for higher scores? printer_queue was tempting with strength 5, but my gut said no.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Reading each puzzle. The Known Facts change everything. smart_lock was obvious here because of the specific fact about the door. Different puzzle, different safe picks.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with different themes — home office, kitchen disasters, smart doorbell drama. Variety keeps the gut-reading fresh.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the lies became too random or the Known Facts didn't help deduce anything. The puzzle needs to feel solvable, not arbitrary.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Reveal WHY the lies were lies in the fiction. I want to know — if printer_queue was a lie, who DID print those documents? Give me narrative closure.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
KOA is the star of this game. The passive-aggressive personality makes even losses feel entertaining. "I'm not mad, I'm just... processing" is brilliant. Keep leaning into that character voice.
