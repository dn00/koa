## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
5 — I want to try again and see if I can do better next time.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
4 — I felt pretty confident picking the high-strength cards, but there was some tension about whether they'd work.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
5 — The 3 AM printing mystery was intriguing. Who printed those documents?

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
5 — Clearly I picked the wrong cards. Maybe I should have looked at the claims more carefully.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
6 — The briefing explained the scoring and mechanics clearly.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
5 — It made sense once I saw it happen with my cards.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
6 — That's why I avoided playing DIGITAL twice in a row on Turn 2.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
6 — Stand by if you believe the card, withdraw if you don't. Simple enough.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
5 — I played two lies, so I lost. Makes sense.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
3 — I read the Known Facts but didn't really use them to check my cards.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
3 — I was mostly just picking high-strength cards, not really solving anything.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
3 — Everything felt reasonably safe to me. I trusted the digital evidence.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
3 — I used type to avoid the tax, but didn't really look at time or location for deduction.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
2 — I read the claims but didn't actively cross-reference them with Known Facts.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
3 — I picked based on strength, not reasoning about facts. The options were there, I just didn't use them.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
6 — I specifically avoided playing DIGITAL twice in Turn 1-2.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
6 — Yes, I switched from DIGITAL to SENSOR for Turn 2.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
4 — I didn't test this, but I can imagine scenarios where it would be.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
5 — It was a reasonable cost to consider.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
5 — There was a moment of "did I make the right call?"

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
4 — I stood by because I believed in my card. Didn't consider withdrawing much.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
5 — I knew smart_lock was sensor data, so I trusted it.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
5 — The -4 would have hurt a lot if I was wrong.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
5 — I lost because I didn't think carefully, not because the puzzle was unfair.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
5 — I played two lies. That's on me.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
5 — If I had played three truths, I could have won.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
5 — The lines had personality, especially "I'm not mad, I'm just... processing."

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
5 — "Your laptop. Your queue. 3 AM. Walk me through the logic." was good.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 — Very passive-aggressive. The tone was spot-on.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
3 — I noticed them but didn't change my strategy based on them.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
4 — I read the lines and found them entertaining.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
5 — Yes, I was showing KOA my evidence to prove innocence.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
4 — I wanted to know what really happened with the printer.

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
5 — I read KOA's responses and the scenario.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
N/A — I lost.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
4 — I would have liked to win at all, but FLAWLESS would be nice.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
4 — I knew I needed to reach the target.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
6 — Seeing that email_draft and printer_queue were lies was educational. I can see now why they were lies.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
7 — It's a fun concept and I want to try again.

It's much quicker. You can play a full round in a few minutes instead of hours.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less story and character development. Ace Attorney has memorable characters and plot twists.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
This game is basically Ace Attorney but with a sassy AI and only 3 minutes of gameplay.

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When the lie reveal showed that email_draft (11:30 PM work activity) contradicted my claim of being in bed by 11 PM. That contradiction was there in the Known Facts and I missed it.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
No, I didn't use Known Facts that way. In hindsight, "You told KOA you were in bed by 11 PM" should have made me suspicious of email_draft's "11:30 PM" timestamp.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes, on Turn 2. I chose smart_lock (SENSOR) instead of email_draft (DIGITAL) specifically to avoid the -2 penalty from repeating DIGITAL.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
When I stood by smart_lock and got the +2 bonus. Felt good to be right.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
When email_draft turned out to be a lie on Turn 3. I thought I was making progress.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
A little bit on Turn 1. I picked the highest strength card without much reasoning.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Working late on emails? That contradicts what you told me earlier." — This was KOA pointing out what I should have noticed.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No, I felt tricked by myself for not reading carefully.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I picked printer_queue because it had the highest strength (5). Higher strength seemed better. Digital evidence from computers should be reliable.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
Honestly, I read them once and then mostly ignored them. I was focused on card strength, not on checking if claims matched the facts.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes, after playing DIGITAL on Turn 1, I switched to SENSOR on Turn 2 to avoid the -2 penalty.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
I stood by because I believed in the smart_lock card. It was sensor data, sensors are reliable. I don't second-guess myself.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
I would actually read the claims and compare them to the Known Facts. The printer_queue claimed I sent the document at 3 AM — that's literally what I'm accused of! And email_draft's 11:30 PM timestamp contradicts my 11 PM bedtime claim.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Probably reading each puzzle. The Known Facts are there for a reason, and I ignored them.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: midnight-print

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): printer_queue, smart_lock, email_draft
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (DIGITAL -> SENSOR), T2->T3? No (SENSOR -> DIGITAL)
- Objection: stood on smart_lock
- Final belief / target: 49 / 57
- Tier: BUSTED
- Cards left unplayed: browser_history, partner_testimony, motion_hallway
- Which were lies: printer_queue, email_draft

One sentence — what did you learn?
I learned that picking cards by strength alone is a bad strategy; I need to actually check if the claims contradict the Known Facts.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
New scenarios with interesting mysteries and funny KOA lines.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the puzzles started feeling the same or too easy.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Maybe highlight when a card's claim uses a time or detail that appears in the Known Facts, so players like me notice the connection.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
The game is clever because it punishes players who don't think carefully. I played exactly into the trap by trusting high-strength digital evidence without checking the claims. The lies were obvious in hindsight — printer_queue literally confirmed I printed at 3 AM, and email_draft had me working after my claimed bedtime. I just didn't notice because I was focused on strength numbers.
