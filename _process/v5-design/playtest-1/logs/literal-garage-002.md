## Part 1: Quick Reactions (answer in under 30 seconds each)

**QR1:** In one word, how did you feel after the puzzle?
Frustrated

## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
5 — I want another shot to do better. The loss stings enough to motivate a retry.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
4 — Not much tension for me. I mostly just looked at strength numbers and picked.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
5 — Mysterious garage door at 2 AM is a fun setup. Made me curious.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
6 — After seeing the lie reveal, I realize I should have compared cards to the Known Facts more carefully.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
6 — Rules were clear. Truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1. Type tax -2. Objection stand/withdraw.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
6 — Makes sense. High strength is high risk, high reward.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
5 — I understood it but didn't think about it much when picking cards.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
6 — Clear. Stand by = bonus if truth, big penalty if lie. Withdraw = small fixed penalty.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
6 — Yes, I played two lies. The math was clear: started at 50, lost 4 on T1, gained 4 on T2, gained 2 on objection, lost 5 on T3. Final 47.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
2 — I didn't really use them. I read them but didn't cross-reference.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
3 — I was mostly just picking high-strength cards. Not much deduction on my part.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
2 — I thought all my cards were safe. Turns out I was wrong twice.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
3 — I didn't use these much. Just looked at strength.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
2 — I read the claims but didn't actively check them against Known Facts.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1–7 scale)
3 — Looking back, I could have reasoned better, but I didn't. I just went for strength.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
2 — Not really. I played SENSOR then DIGITAL then DIGITAL. Didn't plan around it.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
3 — I avoided it turns 1-2 (SENSOR to DIGITAL) but not turns 2-3 (DIGITAL to DIGITAL).

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
4 — I ate the tax on Turn 3. It wasn't worth it because the card was a lie anyway.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
5 — It's reasonable. Encourages variety in evidence.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
5 — It was a real decision moment. I had to decide if I trusted my card.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
5 — I could have withdrawn for a safe -2, but I believed in my card.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
5 — The card was a truth, and I felt confident about it. Standing by paid off.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
6 — Definitely. If I was wrong, -4 would have hurt badly.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
5 — Fair, but I made it hard on myself by not checking Known Facts.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
5 — I lost because I played two lies. My fault for not reasoning carefully.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
5 — Target 57 from 50. Needed +7 net. Definitely doable with good choices.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
6 — The passive-aggressive lines gave KOA personality. "Physics is fascinating."

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
6 — "Your phone disagrees" at the end was a great zinger.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 — Yes, very snarky smart home vibes. "Just like your explanation."

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
3 — I read them but didn't change my strategy based on them.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
5 — I read every KOA line. They were entertaining.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
5 — "Here's my browser history, KOA. See? I wasn't on my phone."

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
4 — I wanted to clear my name. The neighbors are asking questions!

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
5 — I read KOA's responses. They added to the experience.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
N/A — I lost. But the loss felt earned (my bad choices).

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
4 — I would have settled for CLEARED at this point. FLAWLESS feels ambitious.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
4 — I should have been more careful. The tier labels (BUSTED, CLEARED, FLAWLESS) are motivating.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
6 — Very educational. Now I see the contradictions I missed.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
6 — It's clever, but I need to think harder next time. Would recommend to puzzle fans.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney — You're presenting evidence to prove your innocence. The lies feel like presenting forged evidence. KOA is like the prosecutor catching you.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Shorter and more focused. Ace Attorney requires hours; this is a quick daily puzzle.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth. Ace Attorney has full characters and story arcs. This is a single scenario.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with Wordle's daily puzzle format."

## Part 4: Emotional Journey

Map your emotional state at each point (one word or short phrase):

**E1:** Reading the scenario: Intrigued
**E2:** Reading the Known Facts: Noted (but didn't process deeply)
**E3:** Looking at your 6 cards: Confident
**E4:** Choosing Turn 1: Easy (picked highest strength)
**E5:** Seeing the Truth/Lie reveal: Surprised
**E6:** Hearing KOA react: "Physics is fascinating" — Ouch, snarky

**E8:** The Objection prompt: Uncertain but confident
**E9:** Choosing stand/withdraw: Decisive
**E10:** Seeing objection result: Relieved (it was truth!)
**E11:** Choosing Turn 3: Desperate
**E12:** Seeing final outcome and tier: Deflated
**E13:** Reading the lie reveal: "Oh, I see it now"

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
Reading the lie reveal at the end. Motion sensor claimed "no movement" but Known Fact said motion WAS detected. Garage app claimed phone activity at 2:17 AM but Known Fact said no app activity after 11 PM.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Not during play. Only after. Looking back, I should have compared the claims to the facts.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
No. I played DIGITAL twice in a row (T2 and T3) without really considering the tax.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Standing by on the objection and being right. +2 bonus felt earned.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Turn 1 reveal. Played my highest strength card and it was a lie. -4 immediately.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Sort of on Turn 3. I knew I needed points but wasn't sure which card was safe.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Your phone opened the garage. At 2:17 AM. While you were 'asleep.' Your phone disagrees."

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The design is fair. I tricked myself by not reading carefully.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
Highest strength wins. Motion_garage had strength 5. I thought more points = better.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
I read them once at the start: garage door opened 2:15 AM, no phone activity after 11 PM, motion detected near garage around 2 AM, car never left. Then I picked cards by strength without checking back.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Barely. I went SENSOR (T1) to DIGITAL (T2) to DIGITAL (T3). The T2-T3 transition triggered tax. I didn't plan around it.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
I trusted my card. Browser history is digital evidence. Computers don't lie. I played it for a reason.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Actually check each card's claim against the Known Facts. Motion sensor says "no movement" — but Known Facts say motion WAS detected. Red flag I missed.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Reading each puzzle. The Known Facts are different every time. You have to cross-reference.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: garage-door

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): motion_garage, browser_history, garage_app
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (SENSOR to DIGITAL). T2->T3? Yes (DIGITAL to DIGITAL, -2)
- Objection: stood on browser_history (truth, +2)
- Final belief / target: 47 / 57
- Tier: BUSTED
- Cards left unplayed: sleep_tracker, neighbor_testimony, car_dashcam
- Which were lies: motion_garage, garage_app

One sentence — what did you learn?
I learned that high-strength cards can be traps, and I need to cross-reference claims against Known Facts instead of just chasing numbers.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
New scenarios that feel fresh. Different rooms, different suspicious events, different evidence types.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
Repetitive scenarios or feeling like the lies are random and unfair.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Maybe highlight when a card's claim directly contradicts a Known Fact. Though that might make it too easy...

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
Good puzzle design. The lies are fair — they DO contradict the Known Facts. I just didn't look carefully. That's on me. KOA's personality makes the game fun even when losing. "Physics is fascinating" made me smile despite the loss.
