## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
4 — I want to try again because I did so badly, but I'm not sure what I did wrong.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
3 — Not really. I just picked the highest strength cards. Seemed straightforward.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
5 — A car that drove itself while I was asleep? That's a fun mystery.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
4 — I guess I should have picked different cards, but I still don't fully understand why mine were wrong.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
6 — The rules were clear: play 3 cards, avoid lies, hit the target.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
5 — Makes sense. Strong cards are better, lies hurt you.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
5 — I understood it, though I didn't really plan around it much.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
6 — Stand by if you believe your card, withdraw if you're unsure. Simple enough.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
3 — I mean, I played lies. But I didn't expect them to be lies. The gas receipt seemed like solid evidence!

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
2 — I read them but didn't really use them to analyze my cards. They were just background info.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
3 — I felt like I was picking good evidence, not solving anything.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
2 — All my cards felt safe to me. They were all evidence!

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
2 — I noticed them but didn't really analyze them.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
2 — I read the claims but didn't cross-reference them with the Known Facts.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
3 — I picked the strongest card. That felt like a reason.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
2 — Not really. I just picked by strength.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
2 — I played SENSOR after DIGITAL (no tax on T2), then SENSOR after SENSOR (got taxed on T3). Didn't plan it.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
4 — I took the -2 on my last card because sleep_cam was my best remaining option.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
5 — It's not too harsh. Only -2.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
3 — Not really. I stood by because that's what you do.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
3 — I didn't consider withdrawing. I played the card for a reason.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
2 — I thought I did. Turns out I was wrong.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
5 — The -4 really hurt when my card was a lie.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
3 — I'm not sure it was fair. How was I supposed to know the dashcam was fake?

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
2 — Felt like bad luck to me. I picked solid evidence.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
4 — Target of 60 starting from 50 seems doable if you play truths.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
5 — The sarcastic tone came through. "Interesting choice."

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
5 — "You stood by footage that puts you in two places" was pretty good.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 — Definitely passive-aggressive. Very "I'm watching you" energy.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
3 — I noticed them but didn't change my strategy based on them.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
5 — The comments were entertaining even when losing.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
5 — It felt like "here's my proof" each time.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
4 — I wanted to prove I didn't drive the car!

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
5 — KOA's responses were worth reading.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
N/A — I lost badly.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
3 — I would have been happy just clearing at this point.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
3 — I wasn't thinking about tiers. I was just playing cards.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
4 — Seeing that dashcam and gas_receipt were lies was educational. Still not sure why they were lies though.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
6 — Fun concept, but I'd warn them it's trickier than it looks.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Clue / Cluedo — You're looking at evidence and trying to figure out what happened. It's about deduction.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Faster to play. One scenario, a few cards, done in minutes. No need to move around a board.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
In Clue, the deduction is more mechanical — you eliminate options systematically. Here I wasn't sure how to eliminate anything.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Clue but with bluffing and a snarky AI watching you."

**E1:** Reading the scenario: Intrigued
**E2:** Reading the Known Facts: Skimmed
**E3:** Looking at your 6 cards: Confident

---

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
None — I never had an aha moment. Just kept getting hit with lies I didn't expect.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
No. I read the Known Facts but didn't use them to evaluate cards. Looking back, maybe the fact that the front door opened at 2:05 AM matters? But I didn't connect that to anything.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
No. I just picked by strength. I did get taxed on Turn 3 (SENSOR after SENSOR) but that was just how it worked out.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
When the sleep_cam came up as truth on Turn 3. Finally got one right.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Standing by the dashcam and losing 4 belief. I really thought that was good evidence.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Not during play — I felt like I was making good choices. Only in retrospect do I realize I was basically guessing.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"You stood by footage that puts you in two places. Interesting choice." — Made me feel dumb.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
A little. The gas_receipt has strength 5 — the highest! It felt like a trap to punish players who go for strong cards.

---

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I picked gas_receipt because it had strength 5, the highest. Strong cards are better. Digital evidence is reliable.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
Honestly, I didn't really use them. I skimmed them and noted my phone stayed on WiFi and the front door opened twice. But I didn't cross-reference against my cards.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
No. I picked by strength, not type.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
I stood by because I believed in my card. Withdrawing would be admitting I made a mistake.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Maybe actually look at what the cards are claiming and compare to the Known Facts? But that seems like a lot of work.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
I think you're supposed to read each puzzle and figure out which cards contradict the facts. I just didn't do that.

Yes, that's pretty accurate. It's quick like a daily puzzle and KOA definitely interrogates you.

**M7:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
Maybe clearer hints about why a card might be a lie? I felt lost when my cards kept being wrong.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: midnight-drive

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): gas_receipt, dashcam, sleep_cam
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (DIGITAL->SENSOR). T2->T3? Yes (SENSOR->SENSOR, -2)
- Objection: stood on dashcam
- Final belief / target: 41 / 60
- Tier: BUSTED
- Cards left unplayed: spouse_alibi, phone_gps, sleep_meds
- Which were lies: dashcam, gas_receipt

One sentence — what did you learn?
High-strength cards can be traps. Maybe I should actually read the Known Facts and think about what cards are claiming.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
If I could understand why cards are lies. Right now it feels like I'm missing something obvious.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If I keep getting BUSTED without understanding why. Losing is fine, but losing without learning is frustrating.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Maybe after the game, explain WHY each lie was a lie. Like "the gas_receipt claimed you were at a gas station at 3:30 AM, but your phone never left home WiFi."

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
I think this game is designed to catch people like me who don't read carefully. Fair enough. But I wish I understood the puzzle better after losing. The lie reveal just said WHICH cards were lies, not WHY.
