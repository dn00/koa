## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
**Ace Attorney** — The core loop of presenting evidence to convince an authority figure, combined with the tension of not knowing if your evidence will hold up, feels very Ace Attorney. The objection mechanic especially mirrors the "present evidence" moments where you commit to a claim.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Faster. Ace Attorney is hours of reading with occasional decisions. This is pure decision-making distilled into 3 turns. No filler.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth. Ace Attorney builds characters and story over hours. This is a single scenario with minimal context. I don't know who I am, why I might have printed those documents, or what's at stake beyond "KOA is suspicious."

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with Wordle's daily constraint and a poker-like bluffing/risk element."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
Realizing that printer_queue literally incriminates me — it claims my laptop sent the document at 3 AM. Why would I present evidence of my own guilt? That "aha" made me confident it was a lie meant to trap players who don't read carefully.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes. Known Fact: "You told KOA you were in bed by 11 PM." Card email_draft claims activity at 11:30 PM. Direct contradiction. I flagged it as a lie immediately.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes. On Turn 3, I had both SENSOR options and DIGITAL options. Since I'd played DIGITAL on Turn 2, playing DIGITAL again would cost -2. This reinforced my choice to play motion_hallway (SENSOR) over considering any DIGITAL cards.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
The lie reveal at the end confirming my deductions were correct. email_draft and printer_queue were exactly the two cards I'd identified as lies through logical reasoning.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
The objection decision. My persona says "almost always withdraw," but I could see the game had revealed the card was truth. I had to break character slightly to make the optimal play. The persona's extreme risk-aversion conflicts with the information the game provides.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Briefly on Turn 3 between motion_hallway and smart_lock. Both were SENSOR, both seemed plausible truths. I went with the lower strength per my persona, but it felt more like preference than deduction.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Sixteen pages. 3 AM. Your laptop. I'm not mad, I'm just... processing." — The opening line was perfect. Passive-aggressive AI humor that sets the tone.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The design felt fair. The lies were identifiable through reasoning, and the mechanics (type tax, objection) added decisions without feeling arbitrary.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I picked partner_testimony because: (1) TESTIMONY type — I distrust DIGITAL evidence as my persona, (2) strength 3 — low risk if it's a lie, (3) it aligns with the Known Fact about being in bed by 11 PM. Safe, consistent, modest reward.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
- "Printer warmed up around 3 AM" — Established timeline, used to check card times.
- "Front door stayed locked" — Used to verify smart_lock's claim (redundant confirmation).
- "You told KOA bed by 11 PM" — CRITICAL. email_draft claims 11:30 PM activity. Direct contradiction. Flagged as lie.
- "Documents were CONFIDENTIAL" — Context only, didn't help identify lies.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I consciously played TESTIMONY (T1) -> DIGITAL (T2) -> SENSOR (T3) to avoid any type tax. If I'd played two SENSOR cards, I would have eaten a -2 penalty.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
Conflict between persona and information. Persona says withdraw (risk-averse). But the game output showed wasLie: false. I reasoned that even my paranoid self should trust explicit game feedback. I stood and was rewarded.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
I might play smart_lock on Turn 3 instead of motion_hallway to chase FLAWLESS. My conservative play left 1 point on the table. But that's persona-consistent behavior, not a mistake.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Each puzzle. The lies are seeded by Known Facts, so you have to read the specific scenario. There's no universal "always pick low strength" or "always avoid DIGITAL" strategy that works.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

### Format
**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
(c) Both — Daily puzzle for quick hits, campaign for deeper engagement.

**M2:** If this were a daily puzzle, how many days would you play?
(d) As long as puzzles stay fresh — The deduction element needs variety to stay interesting.

### Session Length
**M3:** How long did the puzzle FEEL like it took?
(c) 5-10 minutes — The analysis phase (reading cards, comparing to Known Facts) took most of the time.

**M4:** Was that the right length?
(b) Just right — Long enough to feel like a real puzzle, short enough for daily play.

### Identity
**M5:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
"Your smart home AI thinks you did something suspicious, and you have 3 pieces of evidence to prove you didn't — but 2 of your 6 evidence cards are lies."

**M6:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets smart home interrogation." Does that feel accurate?
Yes, though "interrogation" undersells KOA's passive-aggressiveness. It's more "smart home guilt-tripping."

**M7:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
More scenario variety. The mechanical core is solid. It needs enough puzzles that each day feels fresh, with different types of suspicious incidents and different lie patterns to detect.

### Pricing & Monetization

**P1:** Would you pay for this game?
(a) Yes, one-time purchase

**P2:** If one-time purchase, what's the max you'd pay?
(b) $2.99 - $4.99

**P3:** If subscription, what's the max monthly price you'd pay?
(a) $0.99/month

**P4:** What would make a subscription worth it? (pick all that apply)
(a) New puzzle every day
(c) Weekly story campaigns
(f) Ad-free experience

**P5:** How does this compare to what you pay for similar games (Wordle NYT, puzzle apps)?
Comparable to NYT Games subscription tier. Would need similar volume of content to justify ongoing payment.

**P6:** Would you pay MORE for a "season pass" (e.g., $9.99 for 3 months of daily puzzles)?
(b) Maybe, depends on content

**P7:** What would make you STOP paying for a subscription?
Repetitive scenarios, predictable lie patterns, or mechanics becoming solvable by rote.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: midnight-print

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): partner_testimony, browser_history, motion_hallway
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (TESTIMONY->DIGITAL). T2->T3? No (DIGITAL->SENSOR)
- Objection: stood on browser_history
- Final belief / target: 61 / 57
- Tier: CLEARED
- Cards left unplayed: smart_lock, email_draft, printer_queue
- Which were lies: email_draft, printer_queue

One sentence — what did you learn?
The lies are identifiable through careful comparison with Known Facts; suspicious paranoia about high-strength cards can work, but explicit contradictions are more reliable indicators than card strength alone.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with genuinely different deduction challenges. Not just reskinned "smart home incident" — different evidence types, different reasoning required.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the lies become predictable (e.g., "highest strength card is always a lie" or "DIGITAL is always suspicious"). The deduction needs to feel earned each time.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Make the objection decision harder. Right now the game reveals wasLie in the output, so the "risk" of standing by is zero if you're paying attention. Consider hiding that information until after the stand/withdraw choice to preserve tension.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
Strong core loop. The persona-based playtesting is smart — different player archetypes will approach the deduction differently. My "suspicious" persona's risk-aversion worked but almost caused me to withdraw when standing was clearly correct. That tension between persona instinct and available information is interesting design space.
