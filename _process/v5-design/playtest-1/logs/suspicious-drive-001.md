## Part 1: Quick Reactions (answer in under 30 seconds each)

**QR1:** In one word, how did you feel after the puzzle?
Frustrated

**QR2:** Would you play again tomorrow? (Yes / Maybe / No)
Yes - I want another shot to prove my caution can work.

**QR3:** Did the puzzle feel like a complete experience? (Yes / Mostly / Not really)
Mostly - I got to make meaningful choices, but losing by 2 points because I was too careful stings.

---

## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 - I want a rematch. I identified the lies correctly but my caution at the objection cost me.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
6 - Especially Turn 3, knowing I needed 6 points but could only get 4 from my safe options.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
5 - The "car drove itself" mystery was intriguing. Did someone borrow my car? Sleep-driving?

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
7 - Absolutely. If I had stood by phone_gps at the objection, I would have won exactly.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
6 - The briefing was clear. Truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1, type tax, objection mechanics.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
5 - Made sense once I saw it in action. The asymmetry (lie = strength-1 not just -strength) is subtle but fair.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
6 - Clear. I actively avoided playing TESTIMONY after TESTIMONY.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 - Crystal clear. Stand = +2 if truth, -4 if lie. Withdraw = -2 guaranteed.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 - Perfectly. I withdrew on a truth, costing myself 4 points (the difference between +2 and -2).

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
6 - The facts about door opening times and my key fob being used helped me reason about alibis.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
6 - I correctly identified both lies by reasoning that "evidence proving I was OUT must be false since I claim innocence."

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
7 - Very clear distinction. spouse_alibi and phone_gps felt safe. dashcam and gas_receipt felt like obvious lies.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
5 - Time was most useful (2:10 AM vs 2:15 AM). Location helped distinguish home vs car evidence.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
7 - The dashcam claim "shows you in the driver's seat" directly contradicted my alibi of being asleep.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
6 - spouse_alibi felt like a reasoned safe choice. Moderate strength, testimony, directly supports my alibi.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
6 - I specifically avoided playing sleep_meds (TESTIMONY) after spouse_alibi (TESTIMONY).

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
7 - Absolutely. I went TESTIMONY -> DIGITAL -> SENSOR, no repeats.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
4 - I never chose to eat it. In this puzzle, I could always find a different type.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
5 - Fair enough. It creates interesting sequencing without being brutal.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
7 - Huge tension. I knew phone_gps was probably truth but my paranoia won out.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
7 - Agonizing decision. My persona screamed "withdraw" but my reasoning said "probably safe to stand."

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
5 - I had reasoning to support either choice. The uncertainty is the point, but it felt like a coin flip emotionally.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
7 - The asymmetric risk (-4 vs +2) is exactly why I withdrew. My persona is terrified of -4.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
6 - Fair but punishing for cautious play styles. My correct lie identification wasn't enough.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
6 - Earned loss. I made a strategic choice (withdraw) that cost me, not bad luck.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
5 - 60 from a starting 50 with 3 cards is tight. Requires good plays AND confidence at objection.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
6 - The passive-aggressive lines gave KOA personality. "Partners do say that."

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
6 - "Your phone was home. The question is whether you were." - Sharp and cutting.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 - Yes, KOA felt like a snarky Alexa that's watched too many crime documentaries.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
4 - I noticed them but they didn't change my strategy. More flavor than function.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
6 - I read every line. "Did you leave it behind?" after I withdrew was a good twist of the knife.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
6 - Yes, like laying out my alibi piece by piece.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
5 - I wanted to know what actually happened with my car. The mystery was engaging.

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
7 - Read every KOA response carefully.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
N/A - I lost. The loss felt earned through my overly cautious objection strategy.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
4 - I just wanted CLEARED. My playstyle isn't built for maximizing points.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
5 - Motivated me to not play lies. Didn't motivate aggression.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 - Validating. I correctly identified dashcam and gas_receipt as lies without playing them.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
7 - Good concept, interesting mechanics. Would recommend with the caveat that cautious players may struggle.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney - You're presenting evidence to convince someone of your innocence, piece by piece. The objection mechanic feels like being cross-examined.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Shorter time commitment. Ace Attorney is hours; this is minutes. Same "present evidence, get challenged" feeling in a fraction of the time.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth. Ace Attorney has characters, plot twists, emotional stakes. This is pure puzzle.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with a suspicious smart home and daily puzzle format."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
Realizing that dashcam and gas_receipt both PROVE I was out driving, which contradicts my alibi. They're lies by design - the game is testing if I'll chase high-strength incriminating evidence.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
The Known Fact "Only your key fob was used to unlock the car" combined with "Car GPS logged 47 miles" meant SOMEONE drove my car with my fob. The dashcam showing me in the driver's seat at 2:15 AM would mean I was guilty, so if I'm claiming innocence, it must be a lie.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes, Turn 2. I considered sleep_meds (TESTIMONY) but played phone_gps (DIGITAL) instead to avoid the -2 penalty after spouse_alibi (TESTIMONY).

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
The lie reveal at the end confirming I correctly avoided both lies. My paranoid card analysis was spot-on.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Seeing "wasLie: false" after I withdrew on phone_gps. I threw away 4 points by being too cautious.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
At the objection. Despite my reasoning that phone_gps was probably truth, the withdraw decision felt like hedging a bet rather than a confident deduction.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Your phone was home. The question is whether you were." - Perfectly captures KOA's passive-aggressive doubt.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
The objection mechanic punishes my playstyle. The asymmetric risk (+2 vs -4) is designed to extract commitment, but suspicious players will always take the -2. This might be intentional design.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
spouse_alibi was strength 3 (not too high to be bait), TESTIMONY (not digitally manipulable), and directly supported my alibi. Low strength, low risk, safe points.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
Known Facts establish: car was out 2-4 AM, phone stayed home, door opened twice, only my key fob used. I reasoned that any card showing me OUTSIDE (dashcam, gas_receipt) contradicts my alibi claim, so those must be lies. Cards showing me HOME (spouse_alibi, phone_gps, sleep_cam) support my alibi.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I consciously rotated types: TESTIMONY -> DIGITAL -> SENSOR. Never triggered type tax.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
My persona's core belief: -2 guaranteed beats risking -4. Even though I reasoned phone_gps was true, my paranoia said "the game wants you to stand so it can punish you."

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Fight my instinct and stand by cards I've reasoned are true. My correct lie identification means nothing if I don't capitalize on it at the objection.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Both. The correct strategy requires reading each puzzle's facts and cards, but there's also a meta-strategy about when to be confident. Suspicious players need to learn when to override their caution.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: midnight-drive

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): spouse_alibi, phone_gps, sleep_cam
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No. T2->T3? No.
- Objection: withdrew on phone_gps
- Final belief / target: 58 / 60
- Tier: CLOSE
- Cards left unplayed: sleep_meds, dashcam, gas_receipt
- Which were lies: dashcam, gas_receipt

One sentence - what did you learn?
Correctly identifying lies means nothing if you're too paranoid to commit at the objection; sometimes you have to trust your reasoning and stand by it.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with genuinely different deduction paths. Not just reskinned versions of the same puzzle structure.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If every puzzle has the same pattern (high-strength incriminating cards are always lies). Predictability kills puzzle games.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Show the "narrative truth" at the end - not just which cards were lies, but the actual story of what happened. In midnight-drive, WHO drove my car? Was it sleepwalking? A thief? Let me know the answer to the mystery.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
The game has a genuine tension between risk-taking and caution. My suspicious persona was perfect at identifying lies but terrible at capitalizing. That's interesting design - different player types will have different failure modes. The question is whether the game can accommodate both or if it's secretly optimized for confident players.
