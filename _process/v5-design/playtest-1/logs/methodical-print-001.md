## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 — The FLAWLESS result was rewarding, and I'm curious how other puzzles would challenge my systematic approach.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
5 — There was moderate tension, particularly when categorizing cards as DANGEROUS vs SAFE. Turn 1 felt decisive.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
6 — The midnight printing scenario was intriguing. Who actually printed those documents? The mystery lingered.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
4 — I played optimally according to my analysis, but I wondered if motion_hallway might have been safe after all.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
7 — The briefing was clear and comprehensive. Truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1, type tax, objection mechanics — all well explained.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
6 — The asymmetry makes sense thematically. Lies hurt slightly less than truths help, which felt fair.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
7 — Very clear. I specifically planned my card order to avoid SENSOR after SENSOR.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 — Stand by = +2 if truth, -4 if lie. Withdraw = -2 regardless. Crystal clear risk/reward.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 — I tracked every belief change: +4, +3, +2 (objection), +3 = 62. The math added up perfectly.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
7 — KF3 ("in bed by 11 PM") was crucial for identifying email_draft as a contradiction (11:30 PM work activity).

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
7 — My categorization system (SAFE/SUSPICIOUS/DANGEROUS) gave me a framework. I never guessed.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
7 — browser_history, smart_lock, and partner_testimony all had clear reasoning. motion_hallway felt like a gamble.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
6 — The TIME attribute was most useful for spotting contradictions. Type mattered for sequencing, location less so.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
7 — Every card's claim was checked against all four Known Facts. This was the core of my analysis.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
7 — smart_lock directly supported KF2 (door stayed locked). I had high confidence from the start.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
6 — I specifically planned SENSOR -> TESTIMONY -> DIGITAL to avoid any repeated types.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
7 — Successfully avoided all type tax. No SENSOR after SENSOR, no DIGITAL after DIGITAL.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
4 — In this puzzle, I never faced that tradeoff because my safe cards had different types. But I can see how it would matter.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
6 — Fair deterrent without being crippling. It's a meaningful cost but not game-ending.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
6 — Even with high confidence in partner_testimony, the -4 risk made me double-check my reasoning.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
6 — It tested whether I actually believed my own analysis. Standing by felt like putting my money where my mouth was.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
7 — I had already categorized partner_testimony as SAFE based on KF3 alignment. The decision was clear.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
6 — A 6-point swing is significant when the target is 57. It rewards confident, correct play.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
7 — Two clear lies (email_draft, printer_queue), three safe options, one ambiguous card. Well-balanced.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
7 — I systematically identified the lies using Known Facts. FLAWLESS felt deserved.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
6 — Target 57 from starting 50 meant I needed +7. Three truths could give +10, but one mistake could lose the game.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
6 — The passive-aggressive tone came through. "I'm not mad, I'm just... processing" was personality.

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
6 — "In bed by 11. That's what partners are supposed to say." had skeptical wit.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 — The opening line and responses felt like a suspicious home assistant, not a courtroom.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
4 — I focused on the Known Facts more than KOA's commentary. KOA was flavor, not signal.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
5 — I noted the responses but didn't use them for deduction. They added atmosphere.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
6 — The claim text made each card feel like an argument I was making to KOA.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
5 — I was curious about the mystery, but the mechanical challenge was my primary focus.

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
6 — I read all of KOA's responses and appreciated the writing.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
7 — My systematic categorization worked perfectly. No luck involved.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
6 — After reaching CLEARED at objection, I specifically aimed for FLAWLESS with browser_history.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
6 — Knowing FLAWLESS existed pushed me to avoid settling for just "good enough."

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 — Seeing that email_draft and printer_queue were the lies validated my entire analysis chain.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
8 — Strong puzzle mechanics with good deduction depth. Would recommend to puzzle-loving friends.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney — The structure of presenting evidence, having it challenged (objection), and building toward a verdict feels like a compressed courtroom drama.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
It's much faster. A full Ace Attorney case takes hours; this took minutes. Perfect for daily play.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth. Ace Attorney has character development, plot twists, and emotional stakes built over time.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with daily puzzles and a snarky AI instead of a courtroom."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
Realizing email_draft (11:30 PM work activity) directly contradicted KF3 (in bed by 11 PM). That was the clearest "this is a lie" moment.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes. KF3 states "You told KOA you were in bed by 11 PM." email_draft claims work activity at 11:30 PM. 11:30 PM is after 11 PM. Direct contradiction. Categorized as DANGEROUS.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Not directly, but it influenced my card ORDER. I specifically chose SENSOR -> TESTIMONY -> DIGITAL to avoid any repeated types. If I'd played browser_history (DIGITAL) first, I would have needed to avoid email_draft (DIGITAL) on Turn 2.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
The lie reveal confirming that both cards I marked as DANGEROUS (email_draft, printer_queue) were indeed the lies.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
None. The puzzle was fair and my analysis worked. If anything, I wished for slightly more ambiguity to test my reasoning.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
No. Every card I played had explicit reasoning. motion_hallway was the only card where I was uncertain, and I avoided it.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"In bed by 11. That's what partners are supposed to say." — The skepticism was perfect for the passive-aggressive smart home AI.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The lies were detectable through logical analysis of the Known Facts. Fair design.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I chose smart_lock (strength 4, SENSOR) because: (1) it directly supported KF2 (door stayed locked), making it clearly SAFE; (2) it was the highest-strength SAFE card; (3) playing SENSOR first let me play TESTIMONY next without type tax.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
For each card, I checked: "Does this claim contradict any Known Fact?"
- email_draft: Claims 11:30 PM activity. KF3 says in bed by 11 PM. CONTRADICTION.
- printer_queue: Claims my laptop sent the print. This would INCRIMINATE me, not exonerate. DANGEROUS.
- smart_lock: Claims no unlock events. KF2 says door stayed locked. ALIGNED.
- partner_testimony: Claims in bed by 11. KF3 says I told KOA in bed by 11. ALIGNED.
- browser_history: Claims streaming until 10:45 PM. Before 11 PM bedtime. NO CONTRADICTION.
- motion_hallway: Claims 2:30 AM motion. Could suggest I was awake. SUSPICIOUS but not contradictory.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I planned the sequence SENSOR -> TESTIMONY -> DIGITAL specifically to avoid any repeated types. This was secondary to avoiding lies, but it optimized my score.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
Per my persona: "If I reasoned the card was SAFE -> stand by." I had categorized partner_testimony as SAFE because it aligned with KF3. High confidence -> stand by.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Probably nothing for this puzzle. My analysis was correct. For harder puzzles, I might spend more time on relational analysis between cards, not just fact-checking against Known Facts.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
There's a correct framework: categorize cards by Known Fact alignment, sequence to avoid type tax, stand by cards you've verified. But each puzzle requires reading its specific facts and claims.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

### Format
**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
(a) Daily puzzle — one new scenario per day. The quick completion time suits daily play.

**M2:** If this were a daily puzzle, how many days would you play?
(d) As long as puzzles stay fresh. The variety of scenarios and Known Facts is key.

### Session Length
**M3:** How long did the puzzle FEEL like it took?
(b) 2-5 minutes. Analysis plus three turns plus objection.

**M4:** Was that the right length?
(b) Just right. Quick enough for daily play, substantial enough to feel like real deduction.

### Audience & Channels
**A1:** Where would you MOST expect to find this game?
(b) Web browser. The text-based interface and quick sessions suit web play.

**A2:** What device would you MOST want to play on?
(c) Laptop / desktop. The reading and analysis benefit from a larger screen.

**A3:** If this were free, how often would you ideally play?
(c) Most days. Good daily habit, like Wordle.

### Identity
**M5:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
"It's a daily deduction puzzle where you prove your innocence to a passive-aggressive smart home AI."

**M6:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets smart home interrogation." Does that feel accurate?
Yes, that's accurate. The format is daily puzzle, the fiction is interrogation by KOA.

**M7:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
Puzzle variety. If the Known Facts / lie structures become predictable, the deduction becomes formulaic.

### Sharing / Virality
**M8:** How likely are you to share a result or screenshot from this game with a friend? (1-7 scale)
5 — I'd share a FLAWLESS result or a particularly clever deduction.

**M9:** What would you MOST want to share?
(d) A particularly clever deduction I made. The satisfaction of catching a lie through reasoning.

### Pricing & Monetization

**P1:** Would you pay for this game?
(a) Yes, one-time purchase. For a puzzle game, I prefer owning it outright.

**P2:** If one-time purchase, what's the max you'd pay?
(b) $2.99 - $4.99. Comparable to other daily puzzle games.

**P3:** If subscription, what's the max monthly price you'd pay?
(a) $0.99/month. Low commitment for a daily micro-game.

**P5:** If you paid, what would you feel you're paying FOR? (pick up to 2)
(a) Daily new content, (b) Deep story / campaigns

**P6:** Compared to what you pay for similar games (Wordle NYT, puzzle apps), this feels...
(b) Worth paying about the same

**P7:** Would you pay MORE for a "season pass" (e.g., $9.99 for 3 months of daily puzzles) instead of a monthly sub?
(b) Maybe, depends on content

**P8:** What is the FIRST thing that would make you STOP paying?
(a) Repeated puzzles / stale content. Fresh Known Facts and claims are essential.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: midnight-print

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): smart_lock, partner_testimony, browser_history
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (SENSOR -> TESTIMONY). T2->T3? No (TESTIMONY -> DIGITAL).
- Objection: stood on partner_testimony
- Final belief / target: 62 / 57
- Tier: FLAWLESS
- Cards left unplayed: motion_hallway, email_draft, printer_queue
- Which were lies: email_draft, printer_queue

One sentence — what did you learn?
Systematic categorization of cards against Known Facts reliably identifies lies; both DANGEROUS cards were lies, validating the methodical approach.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
New scenarios with fresh Known Facts and non-obvious lie patterns. The deduction must remain engaging.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If lies became predictable (e.g., "the highest-strength card is always a lie") or Known Facts stopped helping.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Add more ambiguous cards that require cross-referencing claims against each other, not just against Known Facts. This would challenge my methodical weakness (relational lies).

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
The objection mechanic is clever — it rewards confidence in your own reasoning. KOA's personality adds flavor without cluttering the puzzle. Solid design for a micro-daily format.
