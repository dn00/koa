## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 — I felt accomplished after winning but curious how other puzzles play out.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
5 — Some cards gave me bad vibes immediately, but choosing between safe options still felt meaningful.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
6 — Sleep-ordering a drone at 4 AM? That's relatable and funny. I was invested.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
4 — I won, so not much regret. Maybe I could have gone for FLAWLESS but it felt risky.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
6 — The briefing was clear. Truth adds, lie subtracts, don't repeat types.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
5 — Made sense once I thought about it, but the "-1" for lies is a bit arbitrary.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
6 — Clear and simple. I actively planned around it.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 — Very clear. High stakes, simple choice.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 — Yes, I could trace exactly how I got to 62 Belief.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
6 — The "unrecognized user" fact directly contradicted `speaker_log`. That was useful.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
5 — Partly reasoning, partly gut. But the reasoning felt real.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
6 — `bedroom_cam` felt safe; `roommate_statement` felt like gambling.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
5 — Type mattered for penalties. Location helped me notice the living room cards felt suspicious.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
6 — The claims were key. `speaker_log` claimed my voice matched, but Known Facts said "unrecognized user."

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
6 — `bedroom_cam` felt like a reasoned safe pick. Known Facts said cameras were recording all night.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
5 — I considered playing `sleep_tracker` Turn 2 but the SENSOR penalty made me switch to TESTIMONY.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
6 — Yes, I deliberately alternated between SENSOR and TESTIMONY.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
4 — I never actually took the penalty. Maybe I was too cautious.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
6 — It's a meaningful cost but not crippling. Felt balanced.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
6 — Definitely felt the stakes spike. +2 vs -4 is significant.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
5 — For me it felt clear (I trusted my gut), but I can see how it would be agonizing.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
6 — I knew the card had landed positively, and it fit my story. Standing felt right.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
6 — That -4 would have hurt badly. The asymmetry creates real tension.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
6 — Challenging but not unfair. I had tools to reason with.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
6 — I trusted my instincts and they were correct. Felt earned.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
6 — 58 was achievable but required playing well. Exactly at target after Turn 2 objection.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
6 — The passive-aggressive tone came through clearly.

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
6 — "I'm updating both your profiles" and "The wrist that ordered a drone..." made me smile.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
7 — Perfectly captured that energy. Petty, suspicious, tracking everything.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
4 — They set the mood but didn't change my card choices.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
6 — The lines were entertaining enough to read fully.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
6 — It felt like building a defense, piece by piece.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
5 — I wanted to prove my innocence, not just hit a number.

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
6 — KOA's lines were worth reading.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
6 — I identified the lies correctly and played truths only.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
5 — I was curious about it but didn't want to risk my win.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
5 — Knowing FLAWLESS existed made me consider pushing harder on Turn 3.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 — Very satisfying! Confirmed my gut feelings about `speaker_log` and `roommate_statement`.

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
7 — It's clever and unique. Would recommend to puzzle fans.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney — You're presenting evidence to prove your innocence against an authority figure. The back-and-forth with KOA has that courtroom drama vibe, and figuring out which evidence is solid vs. which might backfire feels similar.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
It's much faster. Ace Attorney takes hours; this took minutes. Also, the uncertainty of "which cards are lies" adds genuine deduction that Ace Attorney lacks (there you're just finding the right answer).

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth and character development. Ace Attorney has memorable characters and twisting plots. This is more mechanically focused.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with hidden lies in your own evidence deck."

## Part 4: Emotional Journey

Map your emotional state at each point (one word or short phrase):

**E1:** Reading the scenario: Amused (sleep-ordering a drone is funny)
**E2:** Reading the Known Facts: Focused (okay, let's find the contradictions)
**E3:** Looking at your 6 cards: Suspicious (two of these are lying to me)
**E4:** Choosing Turn 1: Confident (`bedroom_cam` felt right)
**E5:** Seeing the Truth/Lie reveal: Relieved (phew, it was truth)
**E6:** Hearing KOA react: Entertained (passive-aggressive as promised)
**E7:** Choosing Turn 2: Thoughtful (balancing type tax with gut feelings)
**E8:** The Objection prompt: Alert (okay, this matters)
**E9:** Choosing stand/withdraw: Committed (I trust this card)
**E10:** Seeing objection result: Validated (my gut was right)
**E11:** Choosing Turn 3: Cautious (don't blow it now)
**E12:** Seeing final outcome and tier: Satisfied (CLEARED feels good)
**E13:** Reading the lie reveal: Vindicated (called both lies correctly)

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When I noticed `speaker_log` claimed my voice matched but the Known Facts said "unrecognized user" - that contradiction jumped out immediately as a lie.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes. Known Fact #2 states the voice was flagged as "unrecognized user." But `speaker_log` claims "voice matched YOUR profile." That's a direct contradiction. My gut picked up on this immediately.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes. On Turn 2, I considered playing `sleep_tracker` (SENSOR, strength 4) but I had just played `bedroom_cam` (also SENSOR). The -2 penalty made me switch to `partner_alibi` (TESTIMONY, strength 3) instead.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
The lie reveal at the end showing `speaker_log` and `roommate_statement` were both lies - exactly what my gut told me. My instincts were spot-on.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Ending at 62 when FLAWLESS needed 63. So close! But I didn't want to risk playing unknown cards.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Not really. Even when I couldn't fully articulate why, I had feelings about which cards were safe. The Known Facts gave me something to work with.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"The wrist that ordered a drone... also logged deep sleep. Interesting data." - Perfect passive-aggressive suspicion even after I won.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The lies were integrated naturally. `speaker_log` and `roommate_statement` both had narrative reasons to be suspicious, not just mechanical gotchas.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I picked `bedroom_cam` because it directly showed me in bed at 4:17 AM - the exact time of the incident. It was SENSOR type (leaving TESTIMONY open for Turn 2), and the Known Facts confirmed cameras were recording all night. It felt like solid visual proof to start my defense.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
I scanned for contradictions:
- "Unrecognized user" contradicted `speaker_log` (which claimed voice matched MY profile)
- "Cameras recording all night" made `bedroom_cam` feel safe
- Package accepted at 2 PM next day didn't help much
- `roommate_statement` put me in the living room at 4 AM, which felt like admitting guilt

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. After playing SENSOR Turn 1, I switched to TESTIMONY Turn 2 to avoid the -2 penalty. Then Turn 3 I could safely play SENSOR again since my last card was TESTIMONY.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
Pure gut. `partner_alibi` felt right when I played it. It fit my story, didn't contradict any facts, and is the kind of evidence that "should" be true. I trusted my instinct and stood by it.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Maybe take more risks to chase FLAWLESS. I played very conservatively, avoiding any card that gave me bad vibes. Could have analyzed `phone_activity` more carefully - it might have pushed me to 63.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
It's about reading each puzzle. The Known Facts and claims create unique contradictions each time. You need to find the lies for THIS scenario, not apply a formula.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: drone-order

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): bedroom_cam, partner_alibi, sleep_tracker
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (SENSOR -> TESTIMONY). T2->T3? No (TESTIMONY -> SENSOR)
- Objection: stood on partner_alibi
- Final belief / target: 62 / 58
- Tier: CLEARED
- Cards left unplayed: phone_activity, speaker_log, roommate_statement
- Which were lies: speaker_log, roommate_statement

One sentence — what did you learn?
Trusting my gut about which cards "felt wrong" let me avoid both lies and win cleanly.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with clever Known Facts that reward careful reading. Also, more KOA personality - maybe seasonal KOA attitudes or ongoing story threads about my relationship with my suspicious home AI.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the lies felt random rather than deducible. If I felt like I was just guessing, not reasoning, I'd lose interest.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Add a "near miss" indicator when you're 1 point from a higher tier. Knowing I was ONE point from FLAWLESS would have added extra drama.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
The smart home AI framing is genuinely clever. KOA as a character has legs - you could build a whole universe around domestic surveillance comedy. The core mechanic of "your own evidence might be lying" creates a paranoia that fits the smart home theme perfectly. Good stuff.
