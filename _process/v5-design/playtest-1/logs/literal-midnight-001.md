## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
**Ace Attorney** - You're presenting evidence to prove your innocence, and the evidence can backfire if it contradicts the facts. The objection mechanic also feels very Ace Attorney.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Much shorter session length. You can complete a puzzle in a few minutes rather than hours.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth. Ace Attorney has extensive character development and story arcs. This is a quick puzzle with minimal story.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with card-based evidence and a passive-aggressive AI judge."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
The lie reveal at the end showing printer_queue was also a lie. I almost played it Turn 3 for its high strength. The card literally admits my laptop sent the print job at 3 AM - that would have been self-incriminating evidence!

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
No. I didn't actively cross-reference the claims against Known Facts. After the game, I see that the email_draft (11:30 PM) directly contradicted my claim of being in bed by 11 PM. I should have noticed.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes - on Turn 3, I considered printer_queue (strength 5, DIGITAL) but factored in the -2 penalty since email_draft was also DIGITAL. That made partner_testimony (strength 3, TESTIMONY, no penalty) look more competitive.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
The lie reveal at the end. Understanding WHY email_draft and printer_queue were lies made the whole puzzle click.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Standing by the email_draft at objection. I knew it was revealed as a lie, but my persona pushed me to stand by it anyway. That -4 swing was brutal.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Turn 2 felt like guessing. I picked email_draft based on strength without checking if 11:30 PM contradicted my 11 PM bedtime claim.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Sixteen pages. 3 AM. Your laptop. I'm not mad, I'm just... processing." - Perfect passive-aggressive smart home energy.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The lies were fair - both had logical contradictions I should have noticed.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I picked smart_lock (strength 4, SENSOR) because it was high-strength and proved no one entered from outside. It felt like foundational evidence that didn't rely on my alibi timeline.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
I read them once and absorbed them as context, but I didn't actively cross-reference each card claim against them. I should have noticed that "in bed by 11 PM" conflicts with email_draft at "11:30 PM."

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes - I avoided playing SENSOR cards back-to-back (smart_lock then motion_hallway). On Turn 3, I chose partner_testimony partly to avoid the DIGITAL penalty.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
I stood by because my persona believes in its cards. Withdrawing felt like admitting a mistake. This was a bad decision - the game already told me it was a lie.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Actually cross-reference each card's claim against the Known Facts. Check timestamps. Ask "does this claim contradict what I said happened?"

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Both. The core strategy (cross-reference claims vs facts) is universal, but each puzzle requires reading its specific contradictions.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with different types of contradictions. Variety in how the lies are constructed.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If all the lies were the same type of contradiction (always timeline conflicts), or if the puzzles felt same-y.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Highlight the key elements in card claims that might conflict (e.g., timestamps, locations) to help players who miss subtext.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
The Literal persona was a good test - it showed how easy it is to miss contradictions when you don't actively cross-reference. The email_draft lie was fair: 11:30 PM work vs 11 PM bedtime is a clear conflict I should have caught. The printer_queue lie was clever: high strength bait that literally admits guilt. KOA's personality makes the game more engaging than a dry puzzle interface.
