## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
**Ace Attorney** - The feeling of presenting evidence to convince someone of your innocence. The dramatic tension of "will this evidence hold up?" and having to stand by your choices under pressure. Also the character dynamic with KOA as a skeptical interrogator.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Brevity and daily-playability. Ace Attorney requires hours of investment. This takes 3-5 minutes but delivers a similar "aha" moment of piecing together evidence.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth and character development. Ace Attorney has memorable characters and unfolding mysteries. This is more abstract - the scenario is interesting but doesn't have the emotional weight of a full story.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically **Wordle** but with **deductive reasoning and an AI interrogator**."

## Part 4: Emotional Journey

Map your emotional state at each point (one word or short phrase):

**E1:** Reading the scenario: **Intrigued** - "Confidential merger docs at 3 AM? Juicy."
**E2:** Reading the Known Facts: **Focused** - "Okay, let me lock these in."
**E3:** Looking at your 6 cards: **Scanning** - "Which ones feel right?"
**E4:** Choosing Turn 1: **Confident** - "Partner testimony feels safe."
**E5:** Seeing the Truth/Lie reveal: **Validated** - "Yes! Gut was right."
**E6:** Hearing KOA react: **Amused** - "That's what partners are supposed to say" was snappy.
**E7:** Choosing Turn 2: **Calculating** - "Smart lock aligns with known facts."
**E8:** The Objection prompt: **Alert** - "Oh, this is the high-stakes moment."
**E9:** Choosing stand/withdraw: **Certain** - "It felt right when I played it."
**E10:** Seeing objection result: **Triumphant** - "+2, excellent."
**E11:** Choosing Turn 3: **Relaxed** - "I'm ahead. Play it safe."
**E12:** Seeing final outcome and tier: **Elated** - "FLAWLESS! Perfect run!"
**E13:** Reading the lie reveal: **Vindicated** - "I avoided both lies!"

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When I looked at `email_draft` and realized it claimed 11:30 PM activity, but I told KOA I was in bed by 11 PM. That contradiction screamed "LIE" at me. Classic aha moment.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes. Known Fact: "You told KOA you were in bed by 11 PM." The `email_draft` card claimed an email was saved at 11:30 PM. Direct contradiction. That card HAD to be a lie or it would undermine my entire alibi.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Not significantly. I was naturally spreading my types across turns. However, I did consciously note that `browser_history` (DIGITAL) wouldn't trigger tax after `smart_lock` (SENSOR), which made me more comfortable playing it.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Seeing "liesRevealed: email_draft, printer_queue" at the end and realizing my gut had correctly identified both of them as suspicious. I avoided them purely on instinct and feeling.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
None, really. The win came smoothly. If anything, I wish I had been tested more - maybe forced into a harder choice.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
No. I always had a reason (intuitive or logical) for each choice. Even when I couldn't articulate it clearly, my gut had opinions.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"I'm not mad, I'm just... processing." - Perfect passive-aggressive smart home AI energy. Sets the tone immediately.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The design felt fair. The lies were identifiable through reasoning. The mechanics were transparent.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I wanted to establish credibility with KOA using a human witness - my partner. Testimonial evidence from someone who was there with me. It felt like the most natural and trustworthy type of evidence to lead with. Building rapport before getting into technical sensor data.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
I cross-referenced each card's claim against the Known Facts:
- "You told KOA bed by 11 PM" directly contradicted `email_draft` (11:30 PM activity) - marked as suspicious
- "Front door stayed locked" aligned perfectly with `smart_lock` - marked as safe
- "Printer warmed up around 3 AM" made `printer_queue` feel dangerous - it confirmed my laptop was involved
- `motion_hallway` (2:30 AM) felt incriminating - motion right before the print job

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Mildly. I naturally wanted variety, but I did consciously check types before each play to ensure no penalty. TESTIMONY -> SENSOR -> DIGITAL was a clean spread.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
Pure gut. When I played `smart_lock`, it felt right. It aligned with known facts. I had no doubt in my mind. My persona is Intuitive - I trusted that feeling and stood by it.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Honestly, I'd probably play the same way. Trust gut, avoid cards that feel contradictory, stand by cards that feel solid. Maybe I'd take more risks if I was behind.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Reading each puzzle. The known facts vary, the cards vary, the contradictions vary. You have to feel out each scenario fresh.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

### Format
**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
**(a) Daily puzzle** - one new scenario per day

**M2:** If this were a daily puzzle, how many days would you play?
**(d) As long as puzzles stay fresh**

**(b) Just right**

### Identity
**M5:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
"A daily puzzle where you convince your passive-aggressive smart home AI you didn't do something suspicious by playing evidence cards - but some of them are lies."

**M6:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets smart home interrogation." Does that feel accurate?
Yes, that's a good description. The smart home AI vibe is strong, and it does feel like a quick daily puzzle.

**M7:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
More variety in scenarios and KOA's personality reactions. The core loop is solid, but longevity depends on fresh content and memorable moments.

### Pricing & Monetization

**P1:** Would you pay for this game?
**(a) Yes, one-time purchase**

**P2:** If one-time purchase, what's the max you'd pay?

**P5:** How does this compare to what you pay for similar games (Wordle NYT, puzzle apps)?
Comparable. Wordle is free, but I pay for NYT Games bundle. This would fit in that tier - a nice addition to a daily puzzle routine.

**P6:** Would you pay MORE for a "season pass" (e.g., $9.99 for 3 months of daily puzzles)?
**(b) Maybe, depends on content**

**P7:** What would make you STOP paying for a subscription?
Repetitive scenarios, stale KOA dialogue, or puzzles that feel samey. If I start predicting the lies easily, interest dies.

- Cards left unplayed: **motion_hallway**, **email_draft**, **printer_queue**
- Which were lies: **email_draft**, **printer_queue**

One sentence - what did you learn?
**Trusting my gut about which cards "felt wrong" led me to avoid both lies and achieve a flawless victory.**

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios that feel different each time. Varied KOA personalities or moods. Maybe streaks or daily challenges that add slight twists to the formula.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the puzzles started feeling formulaic - same patterns, predictable lies, repetitive KOA lines. The novelty wears off if I can solve them on autopilot.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Add more KOA personality and reactive dialogue based on your specific card choices. Make KOA feel more alive and less like a response machine.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
This was a satisfying experience. The core mechanics work well together - the type tax adds just enough sequencing consideration without overcomplicating things, the objection creates a nice tension spike, and the lie/truth reveal at the end provides closure. The smart home AI framing is clever and differentiating. I'd genuinely play this as a daily puzzle.
