## Part 2: Structured Assessment (1-7 scale, 1=strongly disagree, 7=strongly agree)

### Engagement
**S1:** I wanted to keep playing (or play another puzzle right away).
6 — I won but know I could have done better (FLAWLESS was achievable), which makes me want to try again.

**S2:** I felt tension when choosing which card to play.
5 — The tension was moderate; my systematic approach gave me confidence, but the objection moment was genuinely tense.

**S3:** The scenario was interesting and I wanted to know what happened.
5 — A mysterious garage door opening at 2 AM is intriguing, though the stakes felt somewhat low.

**S4:** I found myself thinking about what I'd do differently.
7 — Absolutely. I withdrew on browser_history when I should have stood. That mistake is already analyzed.

### Clarity
**S5:** I understood the rules after reading the briefing.
7 — The briefing was clear and comprehensive. No confusion about mechanics.

**S6:** The scoring (truth adds strength, lie subtracts strength-1) was intuitive.
6 — Makes sense mathematically, though I had to re-read it once to confirm the asymmetry.

**S7:** I understood the type tax rule (repeat type = -2 next turn).
7 — Crystal clear. I planned my entire sequence to avoid it.

**S8:** I understood the objection mechanic (stand by or withdraw).
7 — Clear risk/reward trade-off: +2/-4 for stand vs guaranteed -2 for withdraw.

**S9:** When I saw the outcome, I understood why I got that result.
7 — Every point was accounted for: +3 (T1), +4 (T2), -2 (withdraw), +3 (T3) = 58.

### Deduction
**S10:** The Known Facts helped me identify which cards might be lies.
6 — KF2 and KF3 were crucial for identifying garage_app and motion_garage as lies. I correctly flagged both.

**S11:** I felt like I was solving a puzzle, not just guessing.
6 — My systematic approach paid off. I identified both lies correctly through logical deduction.

**S12:** I could distinguish between "I think this is safe" and "I'm gambling."
6 — I clearly categorized cards as SAFE, SUSPICIOUS, and DANGEROUS. The distinction was meaningful.

**S13:** The card attributes (type, location, time) were useful for deduction.
5 — Time was most useful (2:17 AM vs KF2's "after 11 PM"). Location helped distinguish "interior" vs "near" the garage.

**S14:** I used the claims to reason about which cards contradict the facts.
7 — This was my primary method. Each card's claim was checked against all four Known Facts.

**D1:** On Turn 1, I felt I had at least one option that was a reasoned choice based on Known Facts (not pure guessing). (1-7 scale)
7 — sleep_tracker had no contradictions with any Known Fact. It was clearly a reasoned safe choice.

### Type Tax
**S15:** The type tax made me think about card order.
6 — I deliberately sequenced SENSOR -> DIGITAL -> TESTIMONY to avoid all taxes.

**S16:** I avoided playing same-type cards back-to-back.
7 — Successfully avoided all type taxes throughout the game.

**S17:** Sometimes the type tax was worth eating for a better card.
4 — Never faced this dilemma in this run since I had enough type variety among safe cards.

**S18:** The -2 penalty felt fair, not punishing.
6 — It's a meaningful cost without being devastating. Good balance.

### Objection
**S19:** The objection after Turn 2 added tension.
6 — The moment of truth. My analysis said SUSPICIOUS, so I withdrew, but I second-guessed myself.

**S20:** Choosing stand/withdraw felt like a real decision.
6 — It forced me to commit to my reasoning. I chose withdraw because of my persona's risk aversion.

**S21:** I had enough information to make a good stand/withdraw choice.
5 — I had information, but I misread it. browser_history was truth, but I was uncertain about phone vs computer browser.

**S22:** The +2/-4 swing for standing by felt high-stakes.
6 — The asymmetry is significant. Standing wrong is -4 (total -6 swing vs withdraw). That's why I withdrew.

### Difficulty
**S23:** The puzzle felt like a fair challenge.
6 — All the information was there to identify the lies. My mistake was overcaution, not unfair design.

**S24:** The win/loss felt earned (not lucky or unfair).
7 — I won because I correctly identified safe cards. I didn't reach FLAWLESS because of my own caution.

**S25:** The target belief was reachable but not easy.
6 — Target 57 from base 50 meant I needed +7 net. Achievable with 3 truths, but tight.

### KOA (the Home AI character)
**S26:** KOA felt like a character, not just a game system.
5 — The passive-aggressive tone came through in lines like "Convenient timing" and "Interesting choice."

**S27:** KOA's lines were memorable or funny.
5 — "Mrs. Patterson sees everything. Usually." was good. The snark landed.

**S28:** KOA felt like a passive-aggressive smart home AI (not a judge).
6 — The tone was definitely judgmental-smart-home, not courtroom-judge. Fit the premise.

**S29:** KOA's responses influenced my thinking.
3 — Not really. I focused on the Known Facts and scoring, not KOA's commentary.

**S30:** I paid attention to what KOA said (not just the score).
5 — I read the lines and appreciated the flavor, but they didn't affect my decisions.

### Narration & Immersion
**S31:** Playing a card felt like presenting evidence.
5 — The framing worked. I was defending myself to an AI that monitors my home.

**S32:** The scenario made me care about the outcome beyond just winning.
4 — Mostly cared about the puzzle mechanics. The narrative was enjoyable but secondary.

**S33:** I read the narration each time (not just skimmed for scores).
6 — I read KOA's responses fully. They added texture to the experience.

### Achievement & Tiers
**S34:** Winning felt earned, not lucky.
7 — I systematically analyzed, played safe cards, and won. Pure deduction, no luck.

**S35:** I wanted FLAWLESS, not just CLEARED.
6 — Yes. Knowing I could have had +2 instead of -2 at objection stings a little.

**S36:** The tier system motivated me to play carefully.
5 — I was already playing carefully due to my persona, but the tiers added goal clarity.

**S37:** The lie reveal at the end was satisfying (or educational if I lost).
7 — Very satisfying. Confirmed my analysis: garage_app and motion_garage were indeed lies. And I learned car_dashcam was truth (my "DANGEROUS" was wrong there).

### Net Promoter Score
**S38:** On a scale of 0-10, how likely would you recommend this game to a friend?
8 — Solid deduction puzzle with clean mechanics. Would recommend to puzzle fans.

## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Ace Attorney — The evidence presentation, objection mechanic, and proving innocence to a skeptical authority figure all echo the courtroom drama format.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Faster pace. Ace Attorney can drag with dialogue; this is a tight 3-turn puzzle that respects your time.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less narrative depth. Ace Attorney has rich characters and plot twists. This is a snapshot scenario without character development.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Ace Attorney but with Wordle's daily puzzle format."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
Realizing that garage_app's claim ("manual override triggered from your phone at 2:17 AM") directly contradicted KF2 ("phone showed no app activity after 11 PM"). That was a clear lie.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
Yes. KF3 states "Motion was detected near the garage around 2 AM." The motion_garage card claims "no movement detected overnight." Direct contradiction. I flagged it as DANGEROUS and the lie reveal confirmed it.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes. I deliberately chose browser_history (DIGITAL) for T2 instead of neighbor_testimony (TESTIMONY) first to ensure I could play TESTIMONY on T3 without any type tax chains. My sequence was SENSOR -> DIGITAL -> TESTIMONY.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
The lie reveal at the end confirming garage_app and motion_garage were lies. My systematic analysis correctly identified both actual lies.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Withdrawing on browser_history only to learn it was truth. I cost myself FLAWLESS by being overcautious. The distinction between "phone browser" and "computer browser" wasn't clear to me.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Briefly at the objection. I had categorized browser_history as SUSPICIOUS because of the 11:30 PM timing, but I wasn't certain whether "browser history" referred to phone or computer.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"Taking back the browser history. Interesting choice." — It felt like KOA was judging my caution, which stung more when I learned it was actually truth.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
Slightly with browser_history. KF2 mentions "phone" specifically, but browser_history's claim doesn't specify device. The ambiguity felt intentional but fair.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
I chose sleep_tracker because it had no contradiction with any Known Fact. The claim (restless sleep at 2 AM) doesn't conflict with any established truth. It was my highest-confidence SAFE card with reasonable strength (3). Starting SENSOR also gave me flexibility for type sequencing.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
I checked each card's claim against all four Known Facts:
- KF1 (door opened 2:15 AM): Used as timeline anchor
- KF2 (no phone activity after 11 PM): Flagged garage_app (2:17 AM phone activity) as lie
- KF3 (motion detected near garage 2 AM): Flagged motion_garage (no movement) as lie
- KF4 (car never left): Confirmed car_dashcam was consistent

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes. I had three safe-ish cards of different types (SENSOR, DIGITAL, TESTIMONY), so I sequenced them to avoid any back-to-back same-type plays. This cost me nothing and saved a potential -2.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
Per my persona, SUSPICIOUS cards warrant withdrawal to avoid -4 risk. browser_history was SUSPICIOUS because 11:30 PM is technically after 11 PM (KF2). I played it safe with -2 guaranteed rather than risk -4.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
I would distinguish more carefully between phone-specific and general digital evidence. browser_history never claimed to be from the phone, so KF2 shouldn't have made it suspicious. I would stand by it next time.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Reading each puzzle. The Known Facts vary, so you need to analyze each card against the specific facts given. But the meta-strategy (check claims against facts, categorize confidence levels, manage type tax) is consistent.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: garage-door

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): sleep_tracker, browser_history, neighbor_testimony
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (SENSOR -> DIGITAL). T2->T3? No (DIGITAL -> TESTIMONY).
- Objection: withdrew on browser_history
- Final belief / target: 58 / 57
- Tier: CLEARED
- Cards left unplayed: car_dashcam, garage_app, motion_garage
- Which were lies: garage_app, motion_garage

One sentence — what did you learn?
I correctly identified both lies through Known Fact analysis, but my overcautious withdrawal on a truth prevented FLAWLESS; next time I should distinguish phone-specific evidence from general digital evidence.

---

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Scenarios that build on each other (weekly arcs with recurring characters or escalating situations) and sufficient variety that the deduction patterns don't become predictable.

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the Known Facts and lies became formulaic. If I can predict lie patterns without reading the specific facts, the puzzle loses its appeal.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Add clarity to ambiguous card claims. For example, specify "phone browser" vs "computer browser" in the claim text when the distinction matters for deduction.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
Solid core loop. The objection mechanic adds genuine tension. KOA's personality elevates it above a pure logic puzzle. With enough scenario variety, this could have real staying power as a daily game.
