## Part 3: Comparisons

**C1:** Which of these games does this remind you of most? Pick one and explain why.
Clue / Cluedo - You're trying to figure out what happened based on limited evidence. The deduction aspect of ruling out possibilities is similar.

**C2:** What does this game do BETTER than the game you picked?
Faster. Clue takes 30+ minutes. This is done in a few minutes. Also the stakes feel more personal - you're defending yourself, not solving someone else's mystery.

**C3:** What does this game do WORSE than the game you picked?
Less social. Clue is multiplayer and you read other players. This is solo.

**C4:** Complete this sentence: "This game is basically ___ but with ___."
"This game is basically Clue but with a sarcastic AI judge and faster rounds."

## Part 5: Key Moments

**K1:** What was the single moment that made you go "oh!" or "aha!"? If none, say "none."
When I saw the lies revealed at the end: motion_garage and garage_app. The motion sensor claimed "no movement overnight" but the Known Facts said "Motion was detected near the garage around 2 AM." That contradiction was obvious in hindsight.

**K2:** Was there a moment where a Known Fact helped you identify a lie? Describe it.
No. I didn't actively cross-reference. In hindsight, the Known Fact "Motion was detected near the garage around 2 AM" directly contradicts the motion_garage card's claim of "all-clear, no movement detected overnight." I should have caught that.

**K3:** Did the type tax ever change which card you played? When?
Yes, on Turn 3. I considered garage_app (DIGITAL, strength 4) but my previous card was DIGITAL. With the -2 penalty, it would only give +2. So I chose neighbor_testimony (TESTIMONY, strength 3) for the full +3.

**K4:** What was the most satisfying moment?
Standing by browser_history at the objection and getting +2 for being correct. Felt good to trust my instincts.

**K5:** What was the most frustrating moment?
Seeing motion_garage was a lie on Turn 1. Strength 5 seemed like an obvious play. I trusted the high number.

**K6:** Did you ever feel like you were just guessing? When?
Turn 1. I picked the strongest card without really analyzing whether it could be a lie. That was basically guessing dressed up as strategy.

**K7:** Was there a KOA line that stuck with you? Quote it if you can.
"The motion sensor saw nothing. The door opened anyway. One of them is lying. I don't think it's the door." - That line was sharp and felt like KOA was calling out my mistake.

**K8:** Did you ever feel tricked by the DESIGN (not by the lies)? When?
No. The design was fair. I just didn't use the tools available (Known Facts) to reason about which cards might be lies.

## Part 6: Strategy & Learning

**L1:** Describe your Turn 1 strategy. Why that card first?
Strength 5 was the highest. I figured bigger numbers are better. Played motion_garage because it was the strongest card. Didn't analyze the claim against Known Facts.

**L2:** How did you use the Known Facts? Walk through your reasoning.
I read them but didn't actively compare them to card claims. The briefing said to cross-reference, but as a Literal player, I just trusted the cards at face value.

**L3:** Did type tax affect your card order? How?
Yes, on Turn 3. Avoided DIGITAL after playing DIGITAL on Turn 2. Switched to TESTIMONY to avoid the -2 penalty.

**L4:** How did you decide stand vs withdraw at the objection?
I had just seen browser_history was truth (+4). Digital evidence is reliable. I trusted my pick and stood by it.

**L5:** If you played again, what would you do differently?
Actually read each card's claim and compare it to the Known Facts. The motion_garage card said "no movement overnight" but the facts said "motion was detected near the garage around 2 AM." That's a direct contradiction I missed.

**L6:** Do you think there's a "correct" strategy, or is it about reading each puzzle?
Reading each puzzle. The lies are specific to the scenario. You have to actually deduce which claims contradict the facts, not just play high-strength cards.

## Part 7: Product & Market Fit

### Format
**M1:** Which format appeals to you more?
(a) Daily puzzle - one new scenario per day

**M2:** If this were a daily puzzle, how many days would you play?
(d) As long as puzzles stay fresh

### Session Length
**M3:** How long did the puzzle FEEL like it took?
(b) 2-5 minutes

**M4:** Was that the right length?
(b) Just right

### Identity
**M5:** How would you describe this game to a friend in one sentence?
A quick daily puzzle where you convince your passive-aggressive smart home AI you didn't do something suspicious by picking which evidence to present.

**M6:** The game is described as "daily puzzle meets smart home interrogation." Does that feel accurate?
Yes. The interrogation vibe is strong. KOA feels like it's questioning you.

**M7:** What's the ONE thing this game needs to be great?
More variety in scenarios. The mechanic is solid, just needs lots of different situations to stay fresh.

### Pricing & Monetization

**P1:** Would you pay for this game?
(a) Yes, one-time purchase

**P2:** If one-time purchase, what's the max you'd pay?
(b) $2.99 - $4.99

**P3:** If subscription, what's the max monthly price you'd pay?
(a) $0.99/month

**P4:** What would make a subscription worth it? (pick all that apply)
(a) New puzzle every day
(f) Ad-free experience

**P5:** How does this compare to what you pay for similar games (Wordle NYT, puzzle apps)?
Comparable. Wordle is free, but NYT Games subscription is ~$5/month. This feels like it could slot into that category.

**P6:** Would you pay MORE for a "season pass" (e.g., $9.99 for 3 months of daily puzzles)?
(b) Maybe, depends on content

**P7:** What would make you STOP paying for a subscription?
Repetitive scenarios or feeling like the deduction is too easy/predictable.

## Part 8: Run Log

### Puzzle: garage-door

- Cards played (T1, T2, T3): motion_garage, browser_history, neighbor_testimony
- Type tax triggered: T1->T2? No (SENSOR to DIGITAL). T2->T3? No (DIGITAL to TESTIMONY).
- Objection: stood on browser_history
- Final belief / target: 55 / 57
- Tier: CLOSE
- Cards left unplayed: sleep_tracker, car_dashcam, garage_app
- Which were lies: motion_garage, garage_app

One sentence - what did you learn?
High-strength cards can be traps. Always check if a card's claim contradicts the Known Facts before playing it.

## Part 9: Final Thoughts

**F1:** What would make you play this every day?
Fresh scenarios with different themes (not just garage doors - kitchen fires, suspicious packages, thermostat wars, etc.)

**F2:** What would make you STOP playing after a week?
If the deduction patterns became predictable or if KOA's lines got repetitive.

**F3:** If you could change ONE thing, what would it be?
Maybe highlight when a card's claim might relate to a Known Fact. As a Literal player, I missed the contradiction entirely. Some players might need a nudge.

**F4:** Any other thoughts?
The lie reveal at the end was genuinely educational. Seeing "motion_garage" and "garage_app" were lies helped me understand what I should have noticed. The Known Fact "Motion was detected near the garage around 2 AM" directly contradicts the motion_garage claim of "all-clear, no movement detected overnight." That's the kind of reasoning I should do next time.

KOA's personality comes through well. The passive-aggressive tone makes the game feel like more than just a scoring exercise. You're actually being judged by someone (something?) with opinions.

Game is tight. Lost by 2 points. Could have won if I'd played smarter on Turn 1.
