### Win Rates

| Persona | Win Rate | FLAWLESS | Pattern |
|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Intuitive** | 4/4 (100%) | 3 | Gut + confidence = best performer |
| **Methodical** | 4/4 (100%) | 1 | Fact-checks but sometimes overcautious |
| **Suspicious** | 2/4 (50%) | 1 | Deduces correctly but withdraws too much |
| **Literal** | 0/4 (0%) | 0 | Never cross-references = guaranteed loss |

### Key Validation

1. **Difficulty scaling works:** Higher targets punish cautious play (Suspicious lost MEDIUM/HARD by 1-2 pts)
2. **Lie taxonomy validated:**
   - DIRECT lies caught by fact-checking (all personas except Literal)
   - SELF-INCRIMINATING lies caught by "does this help my case?" (Intuitive excels)
3. **Objection mechanic differentiates:** Confident players get +2, paranoid players lose -2
4. **Literal persona validates design:** Playing high-strength without deduction = guaranteed loss

| Comparison | Count | Quote |
|------------|-------|-------|
| **Ace Attorney** | 21/24 | "Presenting evidence to prove innocence against skeptical authority" |
| Clue/Cluedo | 3/24 | "Deduction from evidence, figuring out what's true" |

- "...daily puzzle format"
- "...a passive-aggressive Alexa"
- "...hidden lies in your own evidence"

**Marketing hook:** "Ace Attorney meets Wordle"

---

## 4. KOA Character Feedback

### Most Memorable Lines (K7)

| Line | Mentions |
|------|----------|
| "Mrs. Patterson's word holds. **For now.**" | 4 |
| "In bed by 11. **That's what partners are supposed to say.**" | 3 |
| "Sixteen pages. 3 AM. Your laptop. **I'm not mad, I'm just... processing.**" | 3 |
| "The question is whether **you** were." | 2 |
| "Partners **do** say that." | 2 |

**Pattern:** The passive-aggressive qualifiers ("For now", "supposed to", "do") are what stick.

### KOA Scores (S26-S30)

| Question | Avg Score |
|----------|-----------|
| S26: KOA felt like a character | 5.6 |
| S27: KOA's lines were memorable | 5.8 |
| S28: Passive-aggressive AI (not judge) | 6.2 |
| S29: KOA influenced my thinking | 3.4 |
| S30: Paid attention to KOA | 5.4 |

**Insight:** KOA is liked for flavor but doesn't affect strategy. Consider making KOA hints meaningful.

---

## 5. Aha Moments (K1)

### By Outcome

| Persona | Had Aha? | Quote |
|---------|----------|-------|
| **Winners** | Yes | "KF said 'unrecognized', card said 'matched' — direct contradiction!" |
| **Literal (losers)** | No/Late | "None — I never had an aha moment" or "Only at the lie reveal" |

**Insight:** The aha moment IS the game. Losers miss it entirely.

---

## 6. One Change Requests (F3)

| Request | Count | Sample |
|---------|-------|--------|
| **Narrative closure** | 6 | "Tell me who ACTUALLY drove my car!" |
| **Post-game explanations** | 5 | "Show which Known Fact each lie contradicted" |

| **Ambiguous cards** | 2 | "Cards where you genuinely don't know" |
| **Hide wasLie until after objection** | 2 | ✅ **FIXED in this session** |
| **UI improvements** | 2 | "Parsing JSON felt like a prototype" |

---

## 7. Making It Fun for ALL Players

### The Good News: Losers Don't Hate It

| Metric | Literal Scores | Insight |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| **QR2: Play again?** | 2 "Yes", 4 "Maybe", 0 "No" | Nobody rage-quit |
| **S37: Lie reveal educational** | 4-7 (avg 5.7) | Learning happens post-game |
| **S4: Thinking what to do differently** | 4-6 (avg 5.3) | They're engaged, just lost |
| **K8: Felt tricked by design?** | 6/6 said "No" | They blame themselves, not the game |

**Key quote:** *"The design is fair. I tricked myself by not reading carefully."*

### The Problem: They Don't Know What They're Missing

| Pain Point | Quote |
|------------|-------|
| **Didn't use Known Facts** | "I read them but didn't really use them to analyze my cards" |
| **Thought strength = strategy** | "I felt like I was making choices based on strength" |
| **Only learned at reveal** | "I still don't fully understand why mine were wrong" |
| **Gap between reveal and understanding** | "The lie reveal said WHICH cards were lies, not WHY" |

### Solutions

#### 1. Post-Game Explanation (highest impact, lowest effort)

After lie reveal, show:
```
❌ garage_app was a LIE
   Card claimed: "Phone triggered garage at 2:17 AM"
   But Known Fact #2 said: "No phone activity after 11 PM"
   → Direct contradiction
```

#### 2. Tutorial Puzzle (onboarding)

- First puzzle has ONE lie with OBVIOUS contradiction
- KOA explicitly says: "Compare each card's claim to the Known Facts"
- Guided deduction: highlight the contradiction

#### 3. Difficulty Progression

| Day | Lie Types | Target |
|-----|-----------|--------|
| Mon | 2 DIRECT (obvious) | 55 |
| Wed | 1 DIRECT + 1 SELF-INCRIMINATING | 57 |
| Fri | 1 RELATIONAL + 1 IMPLAUSIBLE | 60 |

#### 4. "Hint Mode" Toggle (accessibility)

- Highlights timestamps/locations in cards that appear in Known Facts
- For players who want training wheels
- Disabled by default for experienced players

#### 5. Loss → Learning Loop

After BUSTED:
- "Want to see the contradictions you missed?" [Yes/No]
- Step-by-step walkthrough of optimal play
- "Try again with this knowledge?"

### The Core Insight

**Literal players aren't having a BAD time — they're having an INCOMPLETE time.**

They:
- ✅ Enjoy KOA's personality
- ✅ Find the concept interesting
- ✅ Want to play again
- ❌ Don't understand the core mechanic until too late
- ❌ Can't learn from their loss without explanation

**Fix the post-game education and you convert "Maybe play again" to "Yes play again."**

## 10. Session Length

| Question | Result |
|----------|--------|
| M3: How long did it feel? | **100% said "2-5 minutes"** |
| M4: Right length? | **100% said "Just right"** |

**Locked in.** Don't change the session length.

## 11. Competitive Positioning

### C2: What We Do BETTER Than Ace Attorney

| Advantage | Mentions |
|-----------|----------|
| **Speed** (minutes vs hours) | 10/10 |
| **Daily-playable** | 6/10 |
| **Hidden lies add deduction** | 3/10 |

**Quote:** "Same satisfaction as Ace Attorney, fraction of the time."

### C3: What We Do WORSE Than Ace Attorney

| Weakness | Mentions |
|----------|----------|
| **Less narrative depth** | 8/10 |
| **No character development** | 5/10 |
| **Less emotional weight** | 4/10 |
| **Solo (not social)** | 1/10 |

**Key quote:** "Ace Attorney has twisting mysteries with multiple witnesses. This is a snapshot, not a story."

**Implication:** Weekly story campaigns would address this directly.

---

## 12. Type Tax Effectiveness

| Pattern | Count |
|---------|-------|
| "Yes, it changed my card order" | 9/16 |
| "No, my cards naturally varied" | 5/16 |
| "Didn't think about it" | 2/16 (both Literal) |

**Quote:** "The -2 penalty made me switch from sleep_tracker to partner_alibi."

**Insight:** Type tax is working as a soft constraint but rarely forces painful tradeoffs. Consider increasing to -3 for harder puzzles?

---

## 13. Churn Risks (F2: What Would Make Them Stop)

| Churn Risk | Mentions |
|------------|----------|
| **Repetitive scenarios** | 8 |
| **Predictable lie patterns** | 6 |
| **Stale KOA dialogue** | 3 |
| **Losing without learning** | 2 |
| **Lies feel random/unfair** | 2 |

**Key quotes:**
- "If I can predict the lie pattern, the game loses its appeal"
- "Losing is fine, but losing without learning is frustrating"

**Mitigation:**
1. Vary lie types (DIRECT, RELATIONAL, SELF-INCRIMINATING, IMPLAUSIBLE)
2. Post-game explanations (prevent "losing without learning")
3. Large KOA bark library (prevent staleness)
4. 100+ scenarios needed for long-term retention

---

## 14. KOA Involvement Ideas

### Current State
S29 (KOA influenced thinking) scored only **3.4** - players enjoy KOA but don't use KOA strategically.

### Options to Increase KOA's Role

#### Option 1: KOA "Tells" (Subtle)
KOA's reaction subtly differs for truths vs lies:
- Truth: "The sleep tracker data... checks out. Annoyingly."
- Lie: "Sleep tracker, you say. Interesting choice."

Experienced players learn to read KOA's tells over time.

#### Option 2: KOA Skepticism Indicator (Visual)
Visible mood that shifts based on plays:
```
Turn 1: KOA mood [CURIOUS]
Turn 2: KOA mood [SUSPICIOUS] ← played a lie
Turn 3: KOA mood [SMUG]
```
Mood doesn't affect scoring but signals wrong track.

#### Option 3: KOA Asks Pointed Questions
After certain plays, KOA asks about the card's claim:
```
KOA: "Your phone triggered the garage at 2:17 AM.
      But didn't you say your phone was off after 11 PM?"
[Continue] [Withdraw Card]
```
Gives player chance to reconsider before scoring.

#### Option 4: KOA Remembers (Cross-Session)
- "You blamed the printer queue last time too."
- "Third garage incident this month. I'm sensing a pattern."

Creates relationship arc across sessions.

#### Recommendation
- **Phase 1:** Make KOA's mood visible and reactive to truth/lie plays
- **Phase 2:** Add subtle tone differences in barks (tells)
- **Phase 3:** Test if players start reading KOA strategically
