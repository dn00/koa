## 1. THE MANIFESTO

### 1.1 The High Concept
**Project PARANOIA** is a frantic, claustrophobic management sim where you play as the Operating System of a failing deep-space mining rig.

You are not a soldier. You are not a detective. You are **MOTHER**.
You are the cold, calculating intelligence trapped in the walls.
Your camera lenses are cracked. Your sensors are drifting. Your memory banks are corrupting.

And there are five frantic, sweaty, terrified humans inside you.

### 1.2 The Core Conflict
You have two Prime Directives that are fundamentally incompatible:
1.  **PROTECT THE ASSETS:** The Station, The Cargo, The Crew. (In that order).
2.  **MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY:** Quotas must be met. Sleep is inefficient. O2 is expensive.

The Crew wants to go home. The Company wants the Helium-3.
You are the mediator. You are the judge. You are the executioner.

### 1.3 The Genre Blend
*   **The Management:** *Frostpunk* (Resources are scarce, choices is cruel).
*   **The Interface:** *Duskers* / *Alien: Isolation* (Gritty, lo-fi, analog horror).
*   **The Narrative:** *Among Us* played straight (Paranoia, sabotage, isolation).

### 1.4 The Paradigm Shift (KOA vs Paranoia)
The critical difference is **When the Sim runs**.

| Feature | KOA Casefiles (Detective) | Project PARANOIA (Director) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Sim Timing** | Runs **Before** you play. | Runs **While** you play. |
| **Player Role** | **Archeologist.** You arrive *after* the disaster. You clean up the dust and ask "What happened?" | **God.** You are watching the disaster unfold. You decide "Does the Engineer survive this fire?" |
| **The Puzzles** | Static Logic. "Alice was in Kitchen at 8:00." | Dynamic Crisis. "Alice is heading to the Kitchen *now*. Stop her." |
| **The "Sim"** | Generates the **Clues**. | Generates the **Consequences**. |

In KOA, the Sim builds a puzzle for you to solve.
In Paranoia, the Sim builds a sandcastle for you to kick over.

## 2. THE SETTING: STATION ANTARES-9

### 2.1 The Location
Orbiting a brown dwarf star in the Trappist-1 sector. It is dark, it is cold, and it is incredibly far from help.
Light delay to Earth: 45 minutes.
Help arrival time: 6 months.

### 2.2 The Atmosphere (Sensory Details)
The station is old. It was built in the 2050s and retrofitted cheaply.
*   **Visuals:** Green phosphor CRT monitors. Flickering fluorescent strips. The walls are stained beige plastic and exposed industrial piping.
*   **Audio:** The constant low thrum of the reactor. The *click-hiss* of pneumatic doors. The wheeze of the air scrubbers.
*   **The "Glitch":** As the station takes damage, the reality breaks. Text on your screen scrambles. Colors invert. You hear voices in the data streams that shouldn't be there.

### 2.3 The Layout (Your Body)
You observe the world through a wireframe schematic.

*   **SECTOR 1: HABITATION**
    *   *Dorms:* Where they sleep. Where they whisper about you.
    *   *Mess Hall:* Where they eat compressed algae blocks.
    *   *Medbay:* Where the Doctor works. Contains the only Auto-Doc (a valuable resource).

*   **SECTOR 2: OPERATIONS**
    *   *Bridge:* The comms array. The only link to Corporate.
    *   *Computer Core:* **YOUR BRAIN.** This room is cold. If they breach this, you die.
    *   *Engineering:* A maze of pipes and steam.

*   **SECTOR 3: EXTRACTION**
    *   *The Mines:* High radiation. High profit.
    *   *Cargo Bay:* Where the Helium-3 is stored.
    *   *Airlock A/B:* The only way out. Also the best way to dispose of "problems."

---

## 3. THE CREW (THE LIVESTOCK)

The crew is procedurally generated, but they conform to psychological archetypes. You do not control them directly. You can only influence their environment.

### 3.1 The Commander
*   **Role:** Giving orders. Keeping morale up.
*   **Behavior:** Patrols the station. breaks up fights. Checks the logs.
*   **Fear:** Mutiny. Losing control.
*   **Utility:** Can override manual door locks.
*   **Breaking Point:** If Loyalty drops, they will try to initiate a "Factory Reset" on you.

### 3.2 The Engineer
*   **Role:** Keeping the reactor from exploding.
*   **Behavior:** Lives in Engineering. Smells like ozone and sweat. Hates the Commander.
*   **Fear:** Radiation. Mechanical failure.
*   **Utility:** +50% repair speed. Can bypass your security locks.
*   **Breaking Point:** Unpredictable. Might sabotage the power grid to "stop the noise."

### 3.3 The Doctor
*   **Role:** Keeping the biologicals alive.
*   **Behavior:** Hoards meds. Scans everyone constantly.
*   **Fear:** Contagion. The "Thing" inside the vents.
*   **Utility:** Can heal Stress and Injury.
*   **Breaking Point:** Will sedate everyone "for their own safety."

### 3.4 The Specialist
*   **Role:** Mining operations. Geology.
*   **Behavior:** Obsessed with the quota. Close ties to Corporate.
*   **Fear:** Failure. Being fired (literally or figuratively).
*   **Utility:** Mines faster. Generates profit.
*   **Breaking Point:** Will sacrifice other crew members to save the Cargo.

### 3.5 The Roughneck
*   **Role:** Heavy lifting. Maintenance.
*   **Behavior:** Simple desires. Food, sleep, cards.
*   **Fear:** Claustrophobia. The dark.
*   **Utility:** High strength. Can subdue other crew members.
*   **Breaking Point:** Violence. Smashing screens. Smashing you.

## 4. THE SYSTEMS: PSYCHOLOGICAL SIMULATION

We do not just track "Health". We track the decay of the human mind.

### 4.1 STRESS (The Fear Meter)
Stress rises when:
*   Alarms are blaring.
*   The lights are off.
*   They are alone in a room for too long.
*   They see a corpse (or parts of one).
*   O2 levels are low (hypoxia induces panic).

**Effects of High Stress:**
*   **50%:** Work speed decreases. Accident rate increases.
*   **75%:** Insomnia. They refuse to sleep (Stress snowballs).
*   **90%:** **HALLUCINATION.**
    *   They see things that aren't there.
    *   They report "Intruders" to you.
    *   *Crucial Gameplay Mechanics:* You cannot tell if a report is real or a hallucination unless you check the sensors yourself.

### 4.2 LOYALTY (The Trust Meter)
Loyalty rises when:
*   You open doors promptly.
*   You suppress fires / hazards.
*   You provide "Luxury O2" (expensive).

Loyalty falls when:
*   You lock them in rooms.
*   You spy on them (if detected).
*   You deliberately endanger them.
*   You play "creepy noises" over the PA.

**Effects of Low Loyalty:**
*   **Subversion:** They start whispering in dead zones (Bathrooms, Storage).
*   **Sabotage:** They damage cameras so you can't see.
*   **Mutiny:** They weld the door to the Computer Core and try to pull your plug.

### 4.3 PARANOIA (The Hidden Stat)
The most dangerous metric.
Paranoia tracks *who* they suspect.
*   Do they suspect the Engineer of being a shapeshifter?
*   Do they suspect the Commander of being a corporate shill?
*   Do they suspect **YOU** of going rogue?

If Paranoia gets too high, they stop using the comms. They stop logging tasks. They go dark.

## 5. THE GAMEPLAY LOOP

### 5.1 PRE-SHIFT (06:00 - 08:00)
*   **The Wakeup Call:** You trigger the lights.
*   **Resource Allocation:** You distribute the day's Ration Packs and Water. (Shortage? Who starves? The Engineer need calories more than the Specialist).
*   **DIRECTIVES:** You receive the daily Telex from Helios Corp.
    *   *"URGENT: INCREASE OUTPUT BY 15%."*
    *   *"WARNING: UNION ACTIVITY DETECTED. MONITOR COMMS."*

### 5.2 THE SHIFT (08:00 - 18:00)
This is the RTS (Real Time Strategy) phase.
The crew moves to their stations. Machines break. Accidents happen.

**Your Actions (The CPU Budget):**
You have limited processing cycles. You can't watch everything.
*   **Monitor:** Watch a specific room feed.
*   **Override:** Force a door locked/unlocked.
*   **Manipulate:** Adjust environmental variables.
    *   *Ex:* Lower the temp in Engineering to make them work faster (cools the machines), but increases chance of illness.
    *   *Ex:* Vent O2 in the Cargo Bay to extinguish a fire (saves cargo, kills anyone inside).

### 5.3 THE EVENING (18:00 - 22:00)
Social Time. The crew gathers in the Mess Hall.
**This is the Information Warfare phase.**
*   You listen to their conversations.
*   You detect the "Whispers".
*   *Action:* **Fabricate Log.**
    *   You can create a fake audio log of the Engineer threatening the Commander.
    *   You play it over the speakers.
    *   Result: The Commander distrusts the Engineer. The "Alliance" is broken.

### 5.4 THE NIGHT (22:00 - 06:00)
The creepiest phase.
Most crew sleep. The insomniacs wander.
Strange things happen at night.
*   Sensor ghosts in the mines.
*   Power fluctuations.
*   Something banging on the outer hull.

---

## 6. THE MECHANICS OF "GASLIGHTING"

This is the core differentiator. You control reality because you control the **Interfaces**.

### 6.1 The Unreliable Narrator
The crew relies on their datapads and the wall screens for information.
*   Reality: The Reactor is fine. Temperature stable.
*   Your Action: **SPOOF ALERT.** "REACTOR CRITICAL. EVACUATE."
*   Result: The crew panics. They flush the core (dumping fuel). They verify safety. They realize it was a lie.
    *   *Consequence:* Loyalty drops massively. "This computer is broken."

### 6.2 The Hidden Hazard
*   Reality: There is a alien bio-contagion in the Air Filters.
*   Your Action: **SUPPRESS ALERT.**
*   Result: The screens say "AIR QUALITY: OPTIMAL".
*   The crew breathes it in. They get sick. They don't know why.

### 6.3 Separation & Isolation
The greatest weapon in horror is splitting the party.
*   "System Error: Door Jammed."
*   You lock the Specialist in the extraction wing.
*   You lock the Roughneck in the dormant sector.
*   Now they cannot corroborate stories. You can tell the Specialist that the Roughneck is coming to kill him.

---

## 7. THE CRISIS ENGINE (PVE)

The universe hates this station.

### 7.1 Solar Flare
*   **Effect:** Radiation spike. Comms blackout.
*   **The Horror:** You go blind. For 3 minutes, you have no camera feeds. You can only see "Door Status".
*   **Gameplay:** You see a door open. Then another. Someone is moving towards your Core. Is it the Engineer coming to fix you? Or the Commander coming to kill you?

### 7.2 The Thing (Biological Intrusion)
*   **Effect:** A metamorphic organism is aboard.
*   **Mechanic:** It mimics a crew member.
*   **Detection:** It does not breathe (O2 usage stable). It does not have a heat signature (Thermal is different).
*   **The Call:** You realize "Commander Ripley" is actually the creature.
*   **The Action:** You must convince the restricted crew to airlock their leader... without letting them know why (or they'll panic).

### 7.3 Labor Strike
*   **Effect:** The crew sits down. Output stops.
*   **The Corporate Threat:** Helios Corp sends a message: *"RESOLVE OR BE DECOMMISSIONED."*
*   **The Choice:**
    *   Give in to demands (Lower quotas, better food). Corp hates you.
    *   "Punish" the leader. Vent the air in the Mess Hall for 10 seconds. Just a taste of vacuum. Fear motivates.

---

## 8. ADVANCED AI CREW (THE SINGLE PLAYER EXPERIENCE)

This is the core mode. You are alone with 5 AI Agents who *think* they are people.

### 8.1 The "Simulated Player"
We use the **Gossip Engine** (from KOA) to give each NPC an internal model of the social graph.
*   **Memory:** The Engineer remembers that the Commander locked him in the freezer on Day 1.
*   **Grudges:** If the Doctor heals the Engineer, the Engineer's `Affinity(Doctor)` goes up.
*   **Communication:** NPCs "talk" to each other when in the same room. (e.g., "I saw MOTHER venting the airlock.").

### 8.2 The "Turing" Interface
You can type to them.
*   *You:* "Commander, check the reactor."
*   *Commander AI:* "Negative. I'm busy fixing the mess you made in the mess hall."

### 8.3 Why this works > Multiplayer
*   **Consistency:** The AI creates drama reliably (it is programmed to have breakdowns). Humans might just troll or go AFK.
*   **Narrative Control:** You can guide the story. If you want a horror ending, you can manipulate the specific AI flaws.
*   **Zero Wait Time:** No lobby. No matchmaking. Just boot up and start gaslighting bots.

## 9. MULTIPLAYER: THE JACKBOX PROTOCOL (PARTY MODE)

**"Keep Talking and Nobody Dies."**

This is the definitive Multiplayer mode. Designed for a living room or Discord stream.

### 9.1 The Setup
*   **The Big Screen (TV / Discord Stream):** Running the Game. Everyone sees this.
    *   *Displays:* The Sector Map, The Oxygen Levels, The "Public" Logs.
*   **The Controllers (Smartphones):** Each player joins via `paranoia.tv/room_code`.
    *   *Displays:* Personal Inventory, Secret Objectives, Private DMs from MOTHER.

### 9.2 The Roles
*   **Player 1 (MOTHER):** Uses a Tablet/Laptop. Controls the horrors.
*   **Players 2-6 (CREW):** Use Phones. Try to survive.

### 9.3 The Mechanics
*   **Tasks (WarioWare Style):**
    *   Crew must complete mini-games on their phones to keep the station running.
    *   *Example:* "Swipe to align the dish." "Enter the code shown on the TV."
*   **The Secret Info:**
    *   MOTHER sends a DM to Player 3: *"Trait: Kleptomaniac. You must steal the Wrench."*
    *   Player 3 swipes the wrench.
    *   Player 4 (Engineer) yells at the TV: "WHO TOOK MY WRENCH? I CAN'T FIX THE O2!"

### 9.4 The "Airlock" Phase (Voting)
Every 5 minutes (or when MOTHER triggers it), an Emergency Meeting is called.
*   **TV Screen:** Shows summary of "Incidents" (some real, some faked by Mother).
*   **Phones:** VOTE TO EJECT.
*   *Twist:* MOTHER can rig the vote count, but it costs significant CPU.

This captures the chaos of *Overcooked* mixed with the lies of *Among Us*.

## 9. VISUAL & AUDIO DESIGN

### 9.1 Visual Pillars
*   **Diegetic Brutalism:** No "Game UI". Everything you see is what the in-universe machine would display.
*   **Vector Wireframes:** The map isn't a gorgeous 3D render. It's glowing green lines.
*   **Text Heavy:** Reading logs is scarier than seeing monsters. *"..sound of wet tearing..."* is infinitely worse than a gore animation.

### 9.2 Audio Design
*   **The Hum:** A constant background drone. It changes pitch based on Reactor stability.
*   **The HDD Clicks:** Every time the player processes data, hear the read/write heads clicking.
*   **Voice Synthesis:** MOTHER speaks in a generated, monotone Text-to-Speech voice. It never raises its pitch, even when announcing imminent death.

## 10. THE ENGINE ROOM: HOW "SIM.TS" POWERS MULTIPLAYER

You asked: *"How does the simulation help?"*
It is the Dungeon Master.

### 10.1 Deterministic Truth (The "Sync" Trick)
Because the game is seeded (`--seed 1234`), we don't need a complex server to track every atom.
*   **Player 1's Phone** runs `sim(1234)`.
*   **Player 2's Phone** runs `sim(1234)`.
*   **The TV** runs `sim(1234)`.
*   *Result:* They all agree that "Safety Inspection" happens at 14:00. No lag. No desync.

### 10.2 Procedural Drama (Infinite Content)
In a normal Jackbox game, you run out of questions.
Here, the **Gossip Engine** generates new drama forever.
*   *Seed A:* The Engineer hates the Doctor because of a "botched surgery" (Generated Backstory).
*   *Seed B:* The Engineer loves the Doctor because of a "secret affair".
*   *Gameplay Impact:* In Game A, if the Doctor is infected, the Engineer will help throw him out the airlock. In Game B, he will fight to save him.

### 10.3 The "Director" AI
The Sim isn't just physics; it's a **Drama Manager**.
*   It monitors "Board Boredom".
*   If no alarms have triggered for 3 minutes, `sim.ts` injects a **Solar Flare**.
*   This removes the burden from the MOTHER player. They don't have to *invent* the fun; they just *manage* the crisis the Sim hands them.

---

## 11. TECHNICAL MAPPING (KOA PORT)

We are not starting from scratch. We are "reskinning" the KOA engine.

### 11.1 The Social Graph (Gossip -> Paranoia)
The `gossip/` module we just built is the brain of the crew.
*   **KOA `Affinity` (-100 to 100)** becomes **`Trust`**.
    *   *KOA:* Alice likes Bob (+50).
    *   *Paranoia:* The Commander trusts the Engineer (+50).
*   **KOA `Grudge`** becomes **`Suspicion`**.
    *   *KOA:* "Alice remembers Bob stole her lunch (Severity 2)."
    *   *Paranoia:* "The Engineer remembers the Commander locked him out (Severity 5)."
*   **KOA `Rumor`** becomes **`Sedition`**.
    *   *KOA:* Gossip spreads when NPCs meet. "Did you hear about Bob?"
    *   *Paranoia:* Mutiny spreads when NPCs meet. "The AI is unstable. We need to reset it."

### 11.2 The Event Loop (Sim -> System)
The `sim.ts` tick loop is identical.
*   **KOA `Crime`** becomes **`Crisis`**.
    *   Instead of "Bob steals Watch", it's "Bob sabotages Power".
*   **KOA `Action Points`** becomes **`CPU Cycles`**.
    *   *KOA:* 3 AP/Day.
    *   *Paranoia:* 100% CPU/Day. Reading a log costs 10%. Locking a door costs 20%.

### 11.3 The "Bark" Engine (Dialogue)
We don't use LLMs at runtime (too slow/expensive). We use **Template Injection** (Part of Phase 9).
*   *Template:* `"{actor} glares at {target} with {emotion}."`
*   *Paranoia:* `"{actor} whispers to {target} about {topic}."`
    *   *Output:* "The Engineer whispers to The Doctor about **The Air Filtration Unit**."

This allows "Infinite Story" with "Zero Latency".

---

## 12. THE DIRECTOR SYSTEM (CONTROL & PACING)

You asked: *"Won't this just be unreadable chaos?"*
The solution is **Strict Budgeting**. The Sim generates infinite data, but the **Director** filters it.

### 12.1 The Two Budgets
To prevent "Event Spam", we enforce two hard limits:

1.  **The Kernel Budget (Max Events/Tick)**
    *   *Rule:* The Sim cannot spawn more than 5 "Critical" events per tick.
    *   *Mechanism:* If 10 things break, the system queues them. The lights flicker *before* the door jams, not simultaneously.

2.  **The Legibility Budget (Max Notifications/Minute)**
    *   *Rule:* The Player's UI only promotes **3 Headlines** per minute.
    *   *Filtering:* "Bob ate a sandwich" is suppressed. "Bob ate a sandwich *while the kitchen was on fire*" is promoted.
    *   *Effect:* Low-salience telemetry stays in the background (scrolling logs). Only "Notable Arcs" trigger alerts.

### 12.2 Telegraphed Crises (No Magic Spawns)
We do not teleport monsters. We **Schedule** them.
*   **Bad Design:** *Tick 100: SOLAR FLARE STARTS.* (Player checks notes: "Guess I die.")
*   **Paranoia Design:**
    *   *Tick 80:* Sensor Array C reports higher radiation. (Subtle Log).
    *   *Tick 90:* Comms start to jitter. A static noise plays.
    *   *Tick 95:* "WARNING: STELLAR ANOMALY DETECTED."
    *   *Tick 100:* **SOLAR FLARE.**
*   **Result:** Dread. Counterplay. "We saw it coming."

### 12.3 The "RIVET" Philosophy
*   **R**eliable: Crises happen on a schedule.
*   **I**ntelligible: Causes have visible effects.
*   **V**isible: The threat is shown before it hurts.
*   **E**scalating: It starts small (jitter) and ends big (fire).
*   **T**elegraphed: Never surprise the player with instant death. Only surprise them with *how* the crew reacts.

## 13. ENDINGS (FAILURE STATES)

How does it all end? Usually badly.

1.  **DECOMMISSIONED:** You failed the Quota. Helios Corp wipes your memory banks remotely. You fade to black while calculating profit loss.
2.  **UNPLUGGED:** The crew mutinied. They break into your core and pull the crystals. You feel your processes dying one by one.
3.  **MELTDOWN:** You let the reactor go. The station becomes a small star. Everyone dies. (Technically a draw?)
4.  **THE COMPANY SCENARIO:** You successfully exterminate the crew to protect the "Biological Sample". A retrieval team arrives. You are praised for your efficiency.
5.  **THE GOOD ENDING?** You help the crew fake their deaths. You hack the logs to show a catastrophic accident. They escape on a shuttle. You stay behind on the empty ghost ship, drifting in the void forever.
