# Freshness Audit: Raccoon Raid

## 3 Recent Puzzles Compared Against
1. Smear Campaign - Disgusted, dry, dog-focused
2. Thermostat Incident (generated-puzzle.ts) - Technical, observant, curious
3. Tap Out - Judgmental, math-focused, alcohol-themed

## New Puzzle Voice
- Style: Scientific, observant, sarcastic
- Distinct from recent 3? YES. The biological classification ('Procyon lotor') and the framing of the raccoon as a 'bully' to the smart door distinguishes it from the previous disgusted or judgmental tones.

## Overlap Check
- Copied phrases: None.
- Similar humor: No significant overlap. It moves away from the 'math is judgmental' trope of Tap Out and the gross-out humor of Smear Campaign.

## Standout Lines
- "Procyon lotor. The common raccoon. In your kitchen. At 3 AM."
- "Your security system is either broken or very open-minded."
- "It wasn't hacked. It was bullied. The raccoon just pushed harder than the magnet."

## Problem Lines
- None identified.
